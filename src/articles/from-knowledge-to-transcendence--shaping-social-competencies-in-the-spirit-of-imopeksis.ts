  content: `# Introduction

Tomasz Wilczewski, continuing his Imopeksis training, delves deeper into the topic of social competencies by presenting a hierarchical model of development. This model progresses from knowledge, through skills and competencies, to values, and then to culture (individual, team, social) and transcendence. He places particular emphasis on the critical period of 5-9 years, during which the formation of these competencies is most effective.

## Part 1: Development Hierarchy – From Knowledge to Transcendence

### 1.1. Knowledge

The starting point is the knowledge that a child acquires from conscious adults (parents, teachers, coaches). It is important for this knowledge to be imparted in a way that encourages independent thinking and action, rather than imposing ready-made solutions.

### 1.2. Skill

Theoretical knowledge alone is not enough. A child must have the opportunity to apply knowledge practically, make mistakes, and learn from them.

### 1.3. Competence

Through repeated practice and refinement of skills, a child develops competencies, which are enduring habits and effectiveness in action. Competence is the ability to apply knowledge in various situations.

### 1.4. Value

Value is a deep, internal conviction about the righteousness of a given competence. It is the level at which action becomes selfless and stems from an internal need rather than external compulsion or expectations.

### 1.5. Higher Levels

Above values lie:

- **Individual Culture:** A person becomes a role model for others.
- **Team Culture:** A group of people, guided by shared values, mutually supports and develops.
- **Social Culture:** The influence of an individual and group on the broader society, spreading values.
- **Transcendence:** A level of spiritual connection, dedication to a higher purpose, transcending the individual "self."

## Part 2: Cognitive Curiosity – The Driving Force of Development

### 2.1. Natural Curiosity of a Child

Children are naturally curious about the world. They ask questions ("What are you doing?", "Can I?", "How do you do it?"), explore their surroundings, and want to try everything. This cognitive curiosity is the driving force of their development.

### 2.2. Movement as a Tool of Discovery

Movement is a child's fundamental tool for discovering the world and themselves.

### 2.3. "Flash in the Pan" (10-12 years)

At ages 10-12, cognitive curiosity intensifies, manifesting as a "flash in the pan" – a desire to engage in many diverse activities. Adults should support this curiosity rather than restrict it.

### 2.4. Threats to Cognitive Curiosity

Prohibitions, orders, evaluations, and opinions from adults can inhibit a child's cognitive curiosity.

### 2.5. Loss of Creativity

Wilczewski refers to NASA studies that show children lose creativity with age due to adult pressure and the education system.

## Part 3: Responsibility – The Key to Independence

### 3.1. "Re-sponsibility" – Stepping Back and Allowing Action

The word "responsibility" consists of the prefix "re-" (to step back) and "to speak." It means that an adult should step back and allow the child to make decisions independently and face their consequences.

### 3.2. Decision, Risk, Responsibility

Responsibility is linked to:

- **Decision:** The child must have the opportunity to make decisions independently.
- **Risk:** Every decision involves some risk.
- **Responsibility:** The child must bear the consequences of their decisions.

### 3.3. Avoiding Advising and Coercion

When an adult advises a child on what to do, they take away the opportunity for independent thinking and action. It is important to avoid "words of violence" (e.g., "stop," "do," "don't say") and create situations where the child can reflect and draw conclusions.

### 3.4. Support, Not Replacement

Adults should support the child in the process of making decisions and taking responsibility, but not replace them. Support should be discreet so that the child feels they have made the choice and achieved success on their own.

### 3.5. Life Examples

Wilczewski provides life examples (e.g., a situation with a fireplace, a sports camp situation) to illustrate the importance of giving a child space for independent action and responsibility.

### 3.6. The Importance of Mistakes

Mistakes are a natural part of the learning process. A child should have the opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them.

## Part 4: Moderation – The Path to Happiness

### 4.1. Definition of Moderation

Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has, rather than striving to have more. It is a key factor influencing the sense of happiness and fulfilment.

### 4.2. Research on Happiness

Wilczewski refers to studies showing that happiness is related to:

- **Working in Harmony with Oneself:** Engaging in activities that bring pleasure and a sense of purpose.
- **Having Less:** Moderation in consumption and the pursuit of material goods.

### 4.3. External and Internal Pressure

Wilczewski discusses the problem of pressure, both external (e.g., societal expectations) and internal (e.g., perfectionism). Pressure can lead to frustration and lack of satisfaction.

### 4.4. Self-Realisation and Self-Determination

The key goal of upbringing is to support the child in striving for self-realisation and self-determination. The child should have the opportunity to discover their talents, passions, and goals independently.

### 4.5. Examples from Sport

Wilczewski provides examples of negative behaviours caused by performance pressure.

## Part 5: Sensitive Periods and Developmental Specifics in Years 4-6

Wilczewski returns to the topic of sensitive periods:

- Desire for self-improvement.
- Strong sense of value.
- Period of negative behaviours.
- Seeking enemies.
- Asocial attitude.
- Tolerance.
- Honesty, straightforwardness.
- Flash in the pan.

## Part 6: Communication

Wilczewski highlights the importance of intrapersonal (internal) communication.

## Conclusion

The Imopeksis training, conducted by Tomasz Wilczewski, calls for a paradigm shift in education. By moving away from traditional, compulsion- and assessment-based methods and focusing on understanding the child's psychology, needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, and developing passions.`,
