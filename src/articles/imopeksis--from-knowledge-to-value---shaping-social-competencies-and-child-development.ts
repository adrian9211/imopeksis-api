  content: `# Introduction

In this part of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues an in-depth analysis of the development of social competencies in children, based on a hierarchical model that progresses from knowledge, through skills and competencies, to values, and then to culture (individual, team, social) and transcendence. Special emphasis is placed on the critical period of 5-9 years, highlighting the role of adults in consciously supporting this process.

# Part 1: Hierarchy of Social Competency Development – A Detailed Overview

## 1.1. Knowledge

- The foundation is knowledge, which the child acquires from mindful adults.
- It is important for knowledge to be conveyed in a way that encourages independent thinking.

## 1.2. Skill

- Knowledge alone is not enough. The child must have the opportunity to apply knowledge practically and learn from mistakes.

## 1.3. Competency

- Through repetition and refinement, the child develops competencies – lasting habits and agency in action.

## 1.4. Value

- Value represents a deep, internal belief in the righteousness of a given competency, a level of selflessness.

## 1.5. Higher Levels

- **Individual Culture**: The person becomes a role model.
- **Team Culture**: A group of people guided by shared values.
- **Social Culture**: The influence of the individual and group on society.
- **Transcendence**: The level of spiritual connection, dedication to a higher purpose.

# Part 2: Social Competencies – Examples and Application

## 2.1. Cognitive Curiosity

- A child's natural curiosity is the driving force of their development.
- Adults should support this curiosity, not suppress it (e.g., through prohibitions, orders, judgments).
- The period of 10-12 years is a time of intensified cognitive curiosity ("short-lived enthusiasm").
- NASA studies indicate a decline in creativity in school-aged children due to adult pressure and the education system.

## 2.2. Responsibility

- "Response-ability" – stepping back and allowing the child to make decisions independently and bear the consequences.
- Decision, risk, responsibility – three inseparable elements.
- Avoiding advising and rescuing the child.
- Support, not rescuing – discreetly supporting the child in the decision-making process.
- Life examples (e.g., fireplace, sports camp) illustrating the importance of giving the child space for independent action.

## 2.3. Moderation

- The ability to enjoy what one has rather than striving for more.
- A key factor influencing happiness and fulfilment.
- Research by Csikszentmihalyi: happiness is linked to working in harmony with oneself and having less.
- External pressure (social expectations) and internal pressure (perfectionism) can lead to frustration.

## 2.4. Gratitude

- First level - towards oneself.
- Second - towards a partner.
- Third - towards an opponent.
- Fourth, the most challenging - towards a situation.

# Part 3: Communication and Relationships with Children – Practical Tips

## 3.1. Avoiding "Words of Violence"

- Avoid words that express command, coercion, criticism, judgment, or comparison.

## 3.2. Quiet and Calm Communication

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.

## 3.3. Asking Questions

- Instead of giving orders, ask questions that encourage thinking.

## 3.4. Listening and Understanding

- Listen attentively to the child and try to understand their perspective.

## 3.5. Giving Space

- The child needs space for independent thinking, action, and making mistakes.

## 3.6. "Thinking in Situations"

- Analyzing situations from the perspective of: the situation, the group, the child.

## 3.7. Avoiding Direct Confrontation

- Creating situations where the child reflects independently.

# Part 4: Sensitive Periods and Specifics of Child Development

## 4.1. Sensitive Periods

- Periods in which a child is particularly sensitive to certain stimuli and predisposed to develop specific skills.

## 4.2. Characteristics of Children in Grades 4-6 (9-12 years)

- Desire to work on oneself, strong self-esteem, period of negative behaviours, seeking enemies, antisocial attitude, tolerance, honesty, straightforwardness, short-lived enthusiasm.

## 4.3. Importance of Silence

- The less the teacher speaks, the greater their authority.

# Part 5: Passion, Dreams, and Self-Improvement

## 5.1. Role of Passion and Dreams

- Important for a sense of purpose and direction in life.

## 5.2. Overcoming Oneself

- The ability to overcome one's weaknesses is crucial.

## 5.3. Role of Sport

- Sport as an example of overcoming yourself.

# Part 6: Communication with Parents – Cooperation for the Child's Benefit

## 6.1. Avoiding Forced Evaluations

- Parents should not force teachers to provide grades and information about the child's behaviour. Instead, they should focus on communication with the child themselves.

# Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in education and upbringing. By moving away from traditional, coercion and assessment-based methods and focusing on understanding the child's psychology, needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, and nurturing passion.`,
