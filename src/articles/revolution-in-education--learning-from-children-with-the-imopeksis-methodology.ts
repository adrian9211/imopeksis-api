In the latest edition of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues to showcase practical applications of his methodology, focusing on a deep understanding of child psychology and creating an educational environment that supports natural development. He emphasizes the crucial role of reflection, intrinsic motivation, student-led learning, and the need to move away from traditional teaching methods based on compulsion and assessment.

## Part 1: Understanding the Child – The Key to Effective Education

### 1.1. Children versus Adults – Different Perspectives

Wilczewski repeatedly highlights the fundamental difference between a child's and an adult's perspective. Due to their experiences, thought patterns, and ingrained habits, adults often fail to understand how a child thinks and feels, leading to communication, upbringing, and teaching errors.

### 1.2. Children Fear Teachers

- When an adult approaches, a child's heart rate increases.

### 1.3. "When Do We Play?" – A Signal of Disengagement

- The frequent question "When do we play?" is not an expression of the desire to play but a signal that the lesson is dull, unengaging, and does not meet the child's natural needs (movement, emotions, skill utilization).

### 1.4. Specialist versus Non-Specialist Exercise

- Wilczewski defines specialist exercise as using equipment, while non-specialist exercise involves interaction with another child. He stresses that the best "equipment" for a teacher is the child itself.

### 1.5. Child's Attention

- It is easier to focus a child's attention when they are engaged in interaction with another child rather than focusing on an object (e.g., a ball).

## Part 2: Imopeksis Methodology in Practice – Continuing the Demonstration

### 2.1. "Robot" – Basic Exercise

The lesson begins with the "robot" exercise, which aims to:

- **Activate the Left Brain Hemisphere**: Through a logical sequence of exercises at stations.
- **Activate the Right Brain Hemisphere**: Through observation and imitation of other children ("guards").
- **Develop Creativity**: By inventing different variations of the "robot" movement.
- **Build Social Competence**: Through cooperation, communication, and responsibility ("guards").

### 2.2. "Guards" – The Key to Student-Led Learning

The role of the "guard" is crucial in the Imopeksis methodology. A child in this role:

- **Teaches Others**: Conveys knowledge and skills to peers.
- **Takes Responsibility**: Ensures the group performs exercises correctly.
- **Develops Communication Skills**: Must explain and give instructions clearly and precisely.
- **Builds Self-Confidence**: Taking on a leadership role enhances self-esteem.

### 2.3. Three Phases of the Lesson – Gradation of Difficulty

The lesson is divided into three phases:

- **Teaching**: Introducing new skills (e.g., "quality of movement" in dance).
- **Improvement**: Developing skills in more complex situations (e.g., movement games, combining movements).
- **Training**: Reinforcing skills through intensive training, engaging both body and mind.

### 2.4. Adaptation and Flexibility

The teacher must be flexible and adapt exercises to the children's needs and abilities. They can modify:

- **Pace**: Slow down or speed up the exercises.
- **Rules**: Simplify or complicate the rules of the game.
- **Tasks**: Add new tasks or modify existing ones.
- **Environment**: Change the space where exercises take place.

### 2.5. Use of Games and Play

Games and play (e.g., tag, Grandma's Footsteps) are used as tools to:

- **Release Emotions**: Play allows for tension release and emotional expression.
- **Reinforce Skills**: Children repeat learned movements in a dynamic and engaging way.
- **Develop Cooperation**: Many games require cooperation and communication among children.
- **Increase Intensity**: Games and play can increase the training intensity.

## Part 3: A Deeper Understanding of Child Psychology

### 3.1. Children's Creativity

Wilczewski emphasizes that children are naturally creative, but this creativity is often suppressed by the education system and adult expectations. Research shows a decline in creativity.

### 3.2. Self-Improvement and Imperialism

Children have a natural need for self-improvement and "building their empire" – acquiring knowledge, skills, and experiences.

### 3.3. Gratitude

Gratitude is a key social competence that should be developed in children. Wilczewski provides examples of teaching gratitude at home (e.g., preparing small gifts for guests at birthdays).

### 3.4. Moderation

Moderation, the ability to be content with what one has rather than striving for more, is an important factor influencing happiness.

### 3.5. Communication

Wilczewski outlines four types of communication:

- **Intrapersonal**: Inner dialogue, dreams, imagination.
- **Interpersonal**: Communication between people (words, body language).
- **Indirect**: Communication through signs, symbols, images (e.g., school noticeboards, posters).
- **Media**: Communication via media (television, internet, radio).

He stresses that intrapersonal communication, or inner dialogue, is the most important.

### 3.6. Reflection

Reflection, the contemplation and analysis of one's experiences, is crucial to the learning process. A child needs time to process information and integrate it with their knowledge.

### 3.7. Negative Effects of Phones

Children choose phones because:

- They have autonomy.
- They feel progress.
- They experience failure.
- They have a false sense of closeness.

## Summary

The training led by Tomasz Wilczewski is a call for a revolution in education. The Imopeksis methodology, based on neurodidactics, a deep understanding of child psychology, and practical exercises, aims to create an environment where children can develop their full potential – physically, mentally, and socially. The key is to move away from traditional, compulsion-based, assessment and competition-led methods towards supporting independence, creativity, reflection, and cooperation. The teacher becomes a guide, observer, and adapter, rather than a dictator. This training is not just theory but above all practical tips and inspiration to change the way we think about education and upbringing.`,
