  content: `# Introduction

In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski, drawing on the thoughts of Professor Tadeusz Huczyński, continues the discussion on child upbringing, focusing on communication, emotion management, and supporting independence. He emphasizes the importance of reflection, understanding the child's perspective, and avoiding verbal violence and excessive control.

## Part 1: Communication – The Key to Understanding

### 1.1 Listening and Empathising

- The most important aspect of communication with a child is attentive listening and attempting to understand their perspective.
- It is important to avoid interrupting, judging, and imposing one's own solutions.

### 1.2 "Situation Thinking"

- Instead of reacting impulsively, it is important to analyze the situation from the perspective of:
  - **Situation**: Objective facts.
  - **Group**: The impact of the situation on the group.
  - **Child**: How the child perceives the situation.

### 1.3 Avoiding "Words of Violence"

- Avoid using words that express orders, compulsion, criticism, judgment, or comparison.
- Such words provoke negative emotions and hinder development.

### 1.4 Quiet and Calm Communication

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.
- The tone of voice and body language are as important as the words themselves.

### 1.5 Redirecting to the Child

- Instead of giving ready-made answers, ask questions that encourage the child to think independently and draw conclusions (e.g., "What do you think, did you do well or not?").

### 1.6 Acknowledging the Child's Perspective

- A child has their own rationale which should be acknowledged and respected.
- Imposing one's views can lead to rebellion.

### 1.7 Providing Space

- A child needs space to think, act independently, and make mistakes.

## Part 2: Emotions – Understanding and Managing

### 2.1 Emotions of Women and Men

- Wilczewski discusses the differences in experiencing and expressing emotions between women and men.
- He emphasizes that women often experience emotions more intensely and need more time to process them.
- Men, on the other hand, may have difficulties expressing emotions and understanding women's needs.
- A woman needs to vent emotions, while a man requires facts.

### 2.2 Avoid Reacting Emotionally

- Avoid making decisions and reacting to the behavior of a child/partner in a state of strong emotions.
- It is crucial to calm down first and analyze the situation with a clear mind.

### 2.3 Supporting the Child in Handling Emotions

- A child needs support in dealing with emotions.
- Allow them to express emotions while also teaching them how to control and express them constructively.

### 2.4 The Importance of Reflection

- Reflecting on one's emotions and their causes is crucial for mental and emotional health.

## Part 3: Independence and Responsibility – Keys to Development

### 3.1 "Responsibility"

- Step back and allow the child to make decisions and face the consequences independently.

### 3.2 Decision, Risk, Responsibility

- Responsibility involves making decisions, accepting risk, and facing the consequences.

### 3.3 Avoid Advising and Doing for Them

- Adults should not advise children on what to do or do it for them.
- They should create situations where the child can find solutions independently.

### 3.4 Support, Not Substitution

- Discreetly support the child in decision-making and dealing with difficulties.

### 3.5 Examples from Life

- Wilczewski provides numerous real-life examples to illustrate the importance of giving the child space to act independently and learn from their own mistakes.

## Part 4: Hierarchy of Development

### 4.1 Four Foundations

- Knowledge.
- Skill.
- Competence.
- Value.

### 4.2 Higher Levels

- Individual culture.
- Team culture.
- Society culture.
- Transcendence.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, calls for a paradigm shift in upbringing and education. By understanding the psychology of the child, their needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, developing passions, and adapting communication and methods to the individual characteristics of each child. Parents play a crucial role in this process, supporting the child without doing things for them, giving them space to think and act independently, and teaching them gratitude, responsibility, and respect for themselves and others.`,
