    content: `# Introduction

This part of the Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski and Marta, serves as a practical demonstration and development of the previously discussed principles. Through a series of exercises, initially based on the "robot" figure and then evolving into dance movements, participants experience how the Imopeksis methodology can be adapted to various forms of physical activity. The lesson emphasizes the gradual increase in complexity, student-led learning, continuous observation and adaptation by the teacher, and the creation of an environment where students feel safe, engaged, and motivated to learn.

## Part 1: Repetition and Modification of the "Robots" Exercise

### 1.1. Working at Stations with "Guardians"

The lesson begins with a repetition of the "robots" exercise at stations, led by students in the role of "guardians". Modifications are introduced, such as:

- Focusing on specific body parts (e.g., only arms, only legs, only hips).
- Adding technical elements (e.g., "high chin," "long neck").
- Changing the dynamics and space of movement (e.g., moving in different directions).
- Introducing a "wave" from the head.

### 1.2. Changing "Guardians"

"Guardians" are regularly changed, giving other students the opportunity to take on the leadership role and develop communication and responsibility skills.

## Part 2: Integration of Movements and Group Work

### 2.1. Responding to Signals

Students move on to exercises where they respond to signals (claps), performing specific "robot" movements (e.g., one clap – a specific movement, two claps – a different movement).

### 2.2. Tag with "Robot" Elements

A game of tag is introduced, where the person caught performs a specific "robot" movement, and release occurs by mimicking this movement with an added element (e.g., a leg).

### 2.3. Working in Pairs and Groups

Students pair up, then form threes and fours, performing various combinations of "movement qualities," which require coordination, cooperation, and creativity.

## Part 3: Use of Space and Choreography

### 3.1. "North, South, East, West"

The concept of spatial orientation is introduced, using cardinal directions as reference points for different "movement qualities". Students move to specified locations on signal, performing their assigned movements.

### 3.2. Creating Choreography

Students, divided into teams, create short choreographic sequences using the learned "movement qualities". Team leaders guide the group. The exercise is modified (e.g., performed on the stomach).

### 3.3. Peer Teaching

Students from different teams teach each other their sequences.

## Part 4: Summary and Homework

### 4.1. Repetition of "Movement Qualities"

Students recall the names and key elements of the individual "movement qualities".

### 4.2. Homework

Students are tasked with teaching someone (a parent, sibling, friend) one of the learned "movement qualities" or the entire choreography.

## Summary

This dance lesson, based on the Imopeksis methodology, is a dynamic and engaging experience that demonstrates how effective teaching can simultaneously develop students’ creativity, confidence, and social skills. By moving away from the traditional, authoritarian teaching model and focusing on the needs and potential of the child, Imopeksis offers a new quality in movement education.`,
