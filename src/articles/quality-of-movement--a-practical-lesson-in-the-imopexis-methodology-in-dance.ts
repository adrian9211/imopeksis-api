  content: `# Introduction

In this part of the training, Tomasz Wilczewski from Imopeksis, together with Marta, demonstrates the practical application of his teaching methodology, inspired by dance. The lesson, based on the concept of "movement quality," aims to show how to engage students, develop their skills, and build confidence, avoiding traditional methods based on assessment and criticism.

## Part 1: Lesson Structure – Three Phases of Development

### 1.1. Teaching (Exploration)

**Objective:** Introducing students to the fundamental "qualities of movement."

**Method:** Division into stations where students, under the guidance of "guardians" (selected from among themselves), learn and practice individual qualities:

- **Wave:** A fluid movement resembling the undulation of water, involving the entire body.
- **Swing:** A pendulum-like movement, reminiscent of swinging.
- **Shapes:** "Freezes" – assuming specific positions and holding them momentarily.
- **Shaking:** Vibrations of different body parts.
- **Pumping:** Dynamic movements with distinct stops.

**Role of the Teacher:** Observation, support for "guardians," asking questions, but not imposing solutions. The teacher takes on the role of a novice.

**Role of Students:** Active participation, mutual learning, decision-making (choosing "guardians").

**Left and Right Hemisphere:** The exercise engages both brain hemispheres.

### 1.2. Refining (Skill Development)

**Objective:** Developing the learned movement qualities in more complex situations.

**Method:** Movement games where students use the learnt qualities dynamically (e.g., running around the room and performing specific movements on cue, combining different qualities).

**Role of the Teacher:** Introducing global tasks (e.g., "the caught person must perform a specific movement"), modifying game rules, observing and adjusting the difficulty level.

**Role of Students:** Creativity, adaptation, collaboration.

### 1.3. Training (Consolidation)

**Objective:** Consolidating skills through intensive training, engaging both body and mind.

**Method:** High-intensity and complexity exercises (e.g., "day and night" – running to specific places on cue, creating group choreographies).

**Role of the Teacher:** Observing technique, adjusting workloads, ensuring safety.

**Role of Students:** Physical and mental effort, collaboration, creativity.

## Part 2: Key Principles of the Imopeksis Methodology

### 2.1. Learning through Experience

Students learn through active participation, experimentation, and mutual interactions. The teacher does not impose ready-made solutions but creates conditions for independent discovery.

### 2.2. Role of the "Guardian"

Entrusting students with the role of "guardians" (leaders) promotes responsibility, collaboration, and mutual learning. Children often choose as "guardians" those who might not have had the chance to shine in a traditional model.

### 2.3. Absence of Evaluation and Comparison

Emphasis is placed on individual progress and self-improvement, rather than comparing with others. Each student works at their own pace and according to their abilities.

### 2.4. Engaging the Brain

Exercises engage both hemispheres of the brain: the left (logic, sequences) and the right (imagination, creativity).

### 2.5. Concentration and Mindfulness

Exercises require students to focus attention and be aware of their own bodies.

### 2.6. Adaptation and Flexibility

The teacher must be flexible and adjust exercises to the needs and capabilities of the students.

### 2.7. Safety

Proper brain preparation (warm-up including lateralisation and centring) minimises the risk of injury and collision.

## Conclusion

The presented lesson, based on the Imopeksis methodology, shows how classes can be conducted in an engaging, effective, and safe manner. The key is moving away from the traditional teaching model based on commands and evaluation, towards creating conditions for independent learning, collaboration, and creativity. As a result, students not only develop their movement skills but also build confidence, learn concentration and cooperation, and most importantly – derive joy from learning.`,
