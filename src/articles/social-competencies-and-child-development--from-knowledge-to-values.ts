In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues discussing the development of social competencies in children, focusing on a hierarchical model that progresses from knowledge to values, then to culture (individual, team, social) and transcendence. He emphasizes the critical period of 5-9 years for shaping these competencies and the role of adults in supporting this process.

## Part 1: Hierarchy of Social Competency Development

### 1.1. Knowledge

- The foundation of development is the knowledge that a child acquires from aware parents, teachers, and trainers.
- It is important that this knowledge is conveyed in a way that encourages independent thinking and action.

### 1.2. Skill

- Knowledge alone is not sufficient.
- A child must have the opportunity to test this knowledge in practice, make mistakes, and learn from them.

### 1.3. Competency

- Through repeated practice and improvement of skills, a child develops competency, meaning habits and agency in action.

### 1.4. Value

- Value is a deep, internal conviction of the rightness of a particular competency.
- It represents a level of selflessness and a sense of well-being.

### 1.5. Higher Levels

Above values are:

- **Individual Culture**: A role model.
- **Team Culture**: A group of people who support each other and grow together.
- **Social Culture**: The influence of the individual and group on the broader society.
- **Transcendence**: The connection of souls, dedication to a higher purpose.

## Part 2: Cognitive Curiosity – The Driving Force of Development

### 2.1. Natural Curiosity of a Child

- Children are naturally curious about the world.
- They ask questions ("What are you doing?", "Can I?", "How do you do it?"), explore their surroundings, and want to try everything.

### 2.2. Movement as a Tool of Cognition

- Movement is a child's basic tool for understanding the world and themselves.

### 2.3. Fleeting Enthusiasm (10-12 years)

- At the age of 10-12, cognitive curiosity intensifies, manifesting as "fleeting enthusiasm" – a desire to engage in many different activities.
- Adults should support this curiosity rather than restrict it.

### 2.4. Threats to Cognitive Curiosity

- Prohibitions, orders, assessments, and opinions from adults can inhibit a child's cognitive curiosity.

### 2.5. Loss of Creativity

- With age, children lose creativity due to pressure from adults.

## Part 3: Responsibility – The Key to Independence

### 3.1. "Od-powiedzialność" (Responsibility)

- The word "odpowiedzialność" (responsibility) comprises the prefix "od-" (to move away) and "powiedzieć" (to say).
- It means that an adult should step back and allow the child to make decisions and bear the consequences themselves.

### 3.2. Decision, Risk, Responsibility

Responsibility involves:

- **Decision**: A child must have the opportunity to make decisions independently.
- **Risk**: Every decision involves a certain risk.
- **Responsibility**: A child must bear the consequences of their decisions, both positive and negative.

### 3.3. Avoiding Advising

- When a parent/teacher advises a child on what to do, they take away the child's opportunity for independent thinking and action, as well as assume responsibility for the consequences.
- The difference between "radzić" (to advise) and "sobie radzić" (to cope).

### 3.4. Support, Not Substitution

- Adults should support the child in the process of decision-making and taking responsibility but not substitute them.
- Support should be discreet and unobtrusive, allowing the child to feel they have made the choice and achieved success.

### 3.5. Life Examples

- Wilczewski provides examples from life (e.g., a situation with a fireplace, a situation with a sports camp) to illustrate the importance of giving a child space for independent action and responsibility.

## Part 4: Moderation – The Path to Happiness

### 4.1. Definition of Moderation

- Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has rather than striving to possess more.
- It is a key factor influencing the sense of happiness and fulfillment.

### 4.2. Research on Happiness

- Wilczewski refers to the research of Csikszentmihalyi, who demonstrated that happiness is associated with:
  - **Working in Harmony with Oneself**: Performing activities that provide pleasure and a sense of meaning.
  - **Having Less**: Moderation in consumption and pursuit of material goods.

### 4.3. External and Internal Pressure

- Wilczewski discusses the problem of pressure, both external (e.g., social expectations, advertising) and internal (e.g., perfectionism, ambition).
- Pressure can lead to frustration, stress, and a lack of life satisfaction.

### 4.4. The Importance of Letting Go

- Wilczewski underlines the importance of letting go.

## Part 5: Communication and Relationships with Children

### 5.1. Avoiding "Words of Violence"

- One should avoid "words of violence" in communication with children (e.g., "stop", "do", "don't speak").
- Such words evoke negative emotions and inhibit a child's development.

### 5.2. Quiet and Calm Communication

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.
- Avoid shouting, complaints, and accusations.

### 5.3. Asking Questions

- Instead of giving commands or ready answers, ask questions that encourage the child to think and draw conclusions independently.

### 5.4. Listening and Understanding

- Listen carefully to the child and try to understand their perspective.
- Do not judge, criticize, or interrupt.

### 5.5. Giving Space

- A child needs space for independent thinking, action, and making mistakes.
- Excessive control and interference from adults inhibit a child's development.

## Part 6: Sensitive Periods, and Characteristics of Kids 9-12 Years Old

- Kids want to work.
- They have high self-esteem.
- This is a period of negative behavior.
- They are looking for "enemies".
- They might appear anti-social but really want to be accepted.
- A lot of tolerance is needed.
- They are honest and straightforward.
- They have short-lived enthusiasm.

## Part 7: Importance of Dreams and Passion

- It is crucial to have dreams.
- It is important to awaken passion in kids.

## Part 8: Self-awareness

- Kids need to become self-aware.

# Summary

The Imopeksis training, conducted by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a profound reflection on the nature of children and the educational process. By moving away from traditional, coercion, assessment, and competition-based methods and focusing on understanding child psychology, needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, and developing passion.`,
