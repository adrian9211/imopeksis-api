The conference held on 10 June 2024 in Wińsko, organized by a local institution, trainer, physical education teacher, and parent, addressed fundamental issues concerning child development. The inspiration for the meeting was an interview with Tomasz Wilczewski, who highlighted the need for a deeper understanding of the child's perspective. The training was aimed at teachers, trainers, and parents, with the goal of raising awareness of how everyday interactions and adult expectations influence the development of the younger generation. Part of the meeting was dedicated to charitable purposes.

## Part 1: Understanding Child Development – A Neurological Perspective

### 1.1. Prematurity and Brain Development

- Humans are born prematurely, meaning the brain develops intensively after birth.
- By the age of 5, we reach our full neuronal potential. This period is crucial for the development of creativity and cognitive abilities.
- NASA studies have shown a drastic decline in creativity in school-aged children – from 98% in five-year-olds to just 12% in fifteen-year-olds.

### 1.2. Developmental Periods and Their Importance

- **Ages 9-11:** Characterized by "straw enthusiasm", the desire to try many different activities. It's a time for exploration, not consistency.
- **Age 13:** An egocentric period, gathering information about oneself.
- **Ages 14-16:** A period of negative behaviors and rebellion, particularly challenging for parents, especially mothers. The child tests boundaries.
- **Ages 17-24:** An increase in ethics, morality, willingness to work, and selflessness. The need for an adult authority figure emerges. It's an ideal time for mentoring.
- **Age 25:** End of growth.

### 1.3. Physical vs. Mental Development

- Physical and mental development in children do not progress concurrently.
- Around the age of 14, there is a growth spurt in physical strength. To simultaneously develop the body and mind, a 14-year-old would need an enormous amount of calories (around 40,000), which no digestive system can process.
- This highlights the importance of a wise, rather than just intensive, approach to training and education.

## Part 2: Child’s Needs – Movement, Relationships, Self-Development, and Play

### 2.1. What Truly Motivates a Child?

Contrary to common belief, safety is not the most important thing for a child. Key factors are:

- **Movement:** Children have a natural need for movement, which fosters cognitive curiosity and builds self-confidence. Restricting movement hampers development.
- **Relationships:** Relationships with peers and adults are fundamental. The "child teaches child" method is often more effective than traditional teaching.
- **Self-Development (Imperialism):** This is an internal need for learning and acquiring skills. A child wants to experience and understand themselves.
- **Play:** Play is not just entertainment but a means of learning, expressing emotions, and building relationships.

### 2.2. Emotions and Learning

- Children experience a wide range of emotions (from 116 to 240 according to literature).
- It is important to allow them to experience all emotions, both positive and negative.
- Parents who want their children to always be happy make a mistake.

### 2.3. Reflection

- Reflection is key to learning.

## Part 3: Adults’ Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### 3.1. Pedagogy of Fear

- The education system often relies on fear, humiliation, and criticism, which stifles development.
- Children learn to avoid mistakes rather than learn from them.

### 3.2. Overprotectiveness and Substitution

- Parents who do everything for their children and shield them from all difficulties deprive them of the opportunity for independent development and building self-confidence.

### 3.3. Lack of Understanding of the Child's Perspective

- Adults, due to their experiences and thought patterns, often cannot understand how a child thinks and feels.
- This leads to communication and upbringing mistakes.

### 3.4. Autonomy

- Children want to learn but dislike being told what to do.

### 3.5. Ineffective Teaching Methods

- Traditional teaching methods (lectures, explanations) are ineffective.
- Much more effective are group discussions, personal practice, and peer teaching.

## Part 4: Practical Examples – Sport and Education

### 4.1. Sport as a Development Tool

- Sport can be a powerful tool for development, not only physical but also emotional, social, and cognitive.
- However, it must be conducted wisely, considering the needs and development stage of the child.

### 4.2. Mistakes in Sports Training

- A common mistake is focusing solely on results and introducing competition prematurely.
- This leads to neglecting the individual development of the child and their natural talents.
- Creating game scenarios is important.

### 4.3. Examples of Games and Exercises

- The speaker provided examples of games and exercises that develop social skills (e.g., gratitude game, moderation game) and teach children cooperation.

### 4.4. Education

- Schools do not meet the basic needs of the child.

## Part 5: International Comparisons

### 5.1. China and Germany

- The speaker compared the education system in Poland with those in China and Germany, pointing out differences in approaches to child development.

## Summary

Child development is a complex process that requires adults (parents, teachers, trainers) to have a deep understanding of the child's perspective. It is crucial to move away from traditional, fear and control-based methods of upbringing and education towards supporting the child's natural needs: movement, relationships, self-development, and play. Sport, when conducted wisely, can be a powerful tool supporting this development. We must move away from the pedagogy of fear and excessive control.`,
