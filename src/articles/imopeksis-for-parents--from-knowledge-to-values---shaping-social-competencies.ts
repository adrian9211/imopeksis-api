  content: `# Introduction

In this segment of Imopeksis training aimed at parents, Tomasz Wilczewski focuses on the development of social skills in children and adolescents. He presents a hierarchical model that progresses from knowledge, through skills and competencies, to values, and then to higher levels of culture and transcendence. He emphasizes the importance of understanding this process and actively supporting the child at each stage of their development.

# Part 1: Hierarchical Model of Social Skills Development

## 1.1. Knowledge

- The foundation is the knowledge that the child acquires from aware adults.
- It is important that this knowledge is imparted in a way that encourages independent thinking and action.

## 1.2. Skill

- Knowledge alone is not enough.
- The child must have the opportunity to practically apply knowledge, make mistakes, and learn from them.

## 1.3. Competence

- Through repeated practice and refinement of skills, the child develops competence, which are lasting habits and agency in action.
- Competence is the ability to apply knowledge in new situations.

## 1.4. Value

- Value is a deep, internal belief in the rightness of a given competence.
- It is a level of selflessness where actions stem from an inner need rather than the expectation of a reward.

## 1.5. Higher Levels

- **Individual Culture**: A person becomes a role model.
- **Team Culture**: A group of people guided by shared values.
- **Social Culture**: The influence of an individual and group on society.
- **Transcendence**: A level of spiritual connection, dedication to a higher purpose.

# Part 2: Key Social Skills – Examples and Importance

## 2.1. Cognitive Curiosity

- The natural curiosity of a child is the driving force of their development.
- Adults should support this curiosity rather than suppress it (e.g., through prohibitions, commands, evaluations).
- The age of 10-12 is a period of heightened cognitive curiosity ("flash in the pan").
- Movement is a fundamental tool for a child to explore the world.

## 2.2. Responsibility

- "Re-sponsibility" – stepping back and allowing the child to make decisions independently and bear the consequences.
- Decision, risk, responsibility – three inseparable elements.
- Avoiding advising and doing things for the child.
- Support, not substitution – discreetly supporting the child in the decision-making process.

## 2.3. Moderation

- Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has, rather than striving for more.
- Studies show that happiness is associated with working in harmony with oneself and having less.
- External pressure (social expectations) and internal pressure (perfectionism) can lead to frustration.

## 2.4. Gratitude

- Gratitude is a key social skill that should be developed in children.
- Children are naturally grateful, but adults often suppress this trait.

## 2.5. Empathy and Emotional Intelligence

- Children have a natural ability to empathize and understand others' emotions.

## 2.6. Self-Improvement

- Children have a natural need for self-improvement and learning.

## 2.7. Defence of Autonomy

- Children have a strong need to defend their autonomy and independence.
- Adults should respect this need and give children space for independent action.

# Part 3: Practical Tips for Parents

## 3.1. Avoiding "Words of Violence"

- Avoid words that express command, compulsion, criticism, evaluation, or comparison.

## 3.2. "Situation Thinking"

- Analyze situations from the perspective of: the situation, the group, the child.

## 3.3. Quiet and Calm Communication

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.

## 3.4. Giving Space

- A child needs space to think, act, and make mistakes independently.

## 3.5. Supporting, Not Substituting

- Adults should support the child but not do things for them.

## 3.6. Recognizing the Child's Reason

- A child has their own reasons which should be acknowledged and respected.

## 3.7. Reflection

- Reflection is key to the learning process. A child must have time to think and analyze their experiences.

## 3.8. Importance of Sport

- Sports can teach kids a lot.

# Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in upbringing. By moving away from traditional methods and focusing on understanding the child's psychology, needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, cultivating passions, and adapting communication and work methods to the individual characteristics of each child.`,
