  content: `# Introduction

In this segment of Imopeksis training for parents, Tomasz Wilczewski discusses key psychosocial competencies that play a fundamental role in the development of children and adolescents. He presents a hierarchical model that progresses from knowledge to values, and then to higher levels of culture and transcendence. He emphasizes the importance of understanding this process and actively supporting the child at each stage of their development, as well as how individual competencies manifest in daily life and can be nurtured.

## Part 1: Hierarchical Model of Competency Development

### 1.1. Knowledge

- The foundation is knowledge, which a child acquires from informed adults.
- It is important that it is conveyed in a way that encourages independent thinking.

### 1.2. Skill

- The child must have the opportunity to apply knowledge practically, make mistakes, and learn from them.

### 1.3. Competency

- Through repetition and improvement, the child develops competencies—enduring habits and agency in action.
- Competency is the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new situations.

### 1.4. Value

- Value is a deep conviction about the worthiness of a given competency, a level of selflessness.

### 1.5. Higher Levels

- **Individual Culture:** The person becomes a role model.
- **Team Culture:** A group of people guided by common values.
- **Social Culture:** The influence of individuals and groups on society.
- **Transcendence:** A level of spiritual connection.

## Part 2: Key Social Competencies (Ages 5-9) – Detailed Discussion

### 2.1. Cognitive Curiosity

- A child's natural curiosity is the driving force of their development.
- Adults should support this curiosity, not suppress it.
- Movement is a primary tool for a child to explore the world.
- The period of 10-12 years is a time of heightened curiosity ("short-lived enthusiasm").

### 2.2. Responsibility

- "Re-sponsibility" – to step back and allow the child to make independent decisions and bear the consequences.
- Decision, risk, responsibility – three inseparable elements.
- Avoid advising and doing things for the child.
- Support without doing for – discreetly support the child.

### 2.3. Moderation

- Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has.
- Studies indicate a connection between moderation and happiness.
- External and internal pressures can lead to frustration.

### 2.4. Gratitude

- A key social competency.
- Children are naturally grateful, but adults often suppress this trait.

### 2.5. Communication

- Four types:
  - Intrapersonal
  - Interpersonal
  - Indirect
  - Media

### 2.6. Teamwork

- It is a remedy for negative behaviours.
- Age diversity is important.
- It has its stages: from "I for others" through small and large groups, to a team.

### 2.7. Generosity

- Generosity is more than just giving gifts.
- It stems from a heartfelt need.

### 2.8. Friendship

- Consists of empathy, tolerance, respect, and selfless help.

### 2.9. Love

- The highest level of development.

### 2.10. Sensitive Periods

- Wilczewski reminds about sensitive periods.

## Part 3: Practical Tips for Parents and Teachers

### 3.1. Avoiding "Words of Violence"

- Avoid words expressing command, coercion, criticism, judgement, or comparison.

### 3.2. "Thinking in Situations"

- Analyse situations from the perspective of: situation, group, child.

### 3.3. Quiet Communication

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.

### 3.4. Providing Space

- A child needs space for independent thinking, action, and making mistakes.

### 3.5. Supporting, Not Doing for

- Adults should support the child, but not do things for them.

### 3.6. Recognising the Child's Reasons

- The child has their own reasons, which should be recognised and respected.

### 3.7. Reflection

- Reflection is key to the learning process.

### 3.8. Self-Realisation

- The important role of self-realisation in a child's development.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in upbringing and education. By understanding the psychology of the child, their needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, developing passions, and adapting communication and work methods to the individual characteristics of each child. Parents and teachers play a crucial role in this process, supporting the child but not doing things for them, giving them space for independent thinking and action, and teaching them gratitude, responsibility, and respect for themselves and others.`,
