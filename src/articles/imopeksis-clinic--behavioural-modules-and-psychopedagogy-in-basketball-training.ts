In this part of the training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues to discuss the Imopeksis methodology, focusing on behavior modules (based on the DISC model) and the psychopedagogical aspects of a coach's work. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the individual characteristics of players, adapting communication and training methods to their needs, and creating an environment conducive to development.

## Part 1: Shadow Module and Imopeksyzm – Coach's Self-improvement

### 1.1. Shadow Module

Wilczewski refers to the "shadow module" (likely a concept from previous training sessions), which covers negative traits and behaviors, such as:

- Rejoicing in others' failures
- Suspiciousness
- Feeling victimized
- Dwelling on the past
- Lying
- Not utilizing one's own value
- Feelings of shame and self-contempt
- Judging
- Comparing
- Blaming (oneself or others)
- Giving advice
- Compassion

### 1.2. Imopeksyzm

Wilczewski presents "imopeksyzm" as a method of self-work, involving:

- **Acceptance of Shadows**: Recognizing and accepting one's own flaws and weaknesses.
- **Focusing on Strengths**: Developing and utilizing one's advantages, talents, and skills.
- **Continuous Self-improvement**: Working on oneself, learning from mistakes, and striving to become a better version of oneself.

## Part 2: Behavior Models (DISC) – Understanding and Application

### 2.1. Reminder of DISC Types

Wilczewski reminds us of the four basic DISC types:

- **D (Dominant)**: Confident, decisive, controlling.
- **I (Influencing)**: Sociable, open, enthusiastic.
- **S (Steady)**: Calm, stable, conscientious, empathetic.
- **C (Conscientious)**: Accurate, precise, analytical, logical.

### 2.2. Combinations of DISC Types

Most people have a profile consisting of two dominant types.

### 2.3. Examples of Mixed Profiles

- **Scorer (Extreme D)**: Ruthless, focused on scoring points.
- **Playmaker (CS)**: Conscientious, precise.
- **Showman (Extreme I)**: Extroverted, enjoys being the center of attention.
- **Heart (SI)**: Empathetic, supportive, good leader.
- **Trashman (Extreme S)**: Person for the "dirty work."
- **Lone Wolf (Extreme C)**: Expert, analytical.
- **Stern Father (DS)**: Combines demands with support.
- **Mediator (IC)**: Combines communication and empathy with an analytical approach.

### 2.4. Practical Application

- **Team Dynamics**: Different combinations of DISC types affect team dynamics.
- **Individualized Approach**: The coach should adapt communication, tasks, and working methods to the individual characteristics of players.
- **Examples from Basketball**: Wilczewski provides examples from basketball, illustrating how different DISC types behave on the court and how this can be used in training.
