    content: `# Introduction

In this part of the training, Tomasz Wilczewski and Marta from Imopeksis summarize the presented dance lesson, discussing its key elements and the benefits of applying the Imopeksis methodology for both students and teachers. They emphasize the simplicity and effectiveness of the approach, contrasting it with traditional, authoritarian teaching methods.

## Part 1: Reflection on the Lesson

### 1.1. Absence of Negative Behaviors

- Training participants note the absence of negative behaviors, competition, and judgment during the lesson.
- Every child felt engaged and appreciated.

### 1.2. Simplicity and Effectiveness

- Wilczewski highlights that the Imopeksis method is based on simple yet fundamental principles, rather than complex, "American" exercises.
- The key is understanding and utilizing children's potential.

### 1.3. Role of Marta

- Marta, the co-leader of the lesson, acted as an observer and support, rather than a dominating instructor.
- This allowed for independence and creativity among the children.

### 1.4. Fun and Learning

- The lesson demonstrated that learning and fun can go hand in hand.
- Children learned through experience, cooperation, and play.

## Part 2: Building Confidence Through "Resources"

### 2.1. A Child's "Resources"

- Wilczewski defines "resources" as the knowledge, skills, and social competencies a child acquires.
- Building confidence is based on developing these resources, rather than external rewards or praise.

### 2.2. Avoiding Depression

- Having "resources" provides a child with a sense of value and agency, protecting against depression and feelings of worthlessness.

### 2.3. Dangers of External Resources

- Wilczewski warns against excessively providing children with external resources (e.g., material), as this may lead to a lack of coping skills and loss of motivation.

## Part 3: The Three Phases of the Lesson – Detailed Overview

### 3.1. Teaching

- **Objective**: Familiarizing students with new skills/knowledge.
- **Method**: Stations (circuits) with simple, logically connected exercises. Utilizing "guardians."
- **Role of the Teacher**: Supportive – aiding understanding, providing guidance (details), but not imposing solutions.
- **Logic**: Arrangement of stations.

### 3.2. Refinement/Improvement

- **Objective**: Developing learned skills in more complex situations.
- **Method**: Movement games, integration of various elements, working in pairs/groups.
- **Role of the Teacher**: Creative – introducing global tasks, modifying rules, observing and adapting.
- **Emotional Load**: Use of games.

### 3.3. Training/Practice

- **Objective**: Reinforcing skills through intensive training, engaging both body and mind.
- **Method**: High-intensity and complex exercises, limited time, psychological pressure (but internal, not imposed by the teacher).
- **Role of the Teacher**: Enforcement (not through criticism, but by setting challenges and monitoring progress), observation, adjusting load.
- **Intensity**: External factor to increase intensity.

## Part 4: Social Competencies Developed Through Imopeksis Methodology

### 4.1. "Guardian"

Serving as a "guardian" develops:

- Responsibility.
- Communication skills (speaking, giving guidance).
- Creativity.
- Mindfulness.

### 4.2. Refinement and Training

These phases develop:

- Cooperation.
- Moderation.
- Emotional intelligence.
- Order of thought.
- Empathy.

## Part 5: Importance of Reflection and Long-Term Impact of the Lesson

### 5.1. Reflection

- The most important element of the lesson is reflection – the students' experience and analysis of their own experiences.

### 5.2. Long-Term Impact

- The lesson does not end after 45 minutes. The most important processes occur later when the student processes information and integrates it with their knowledge and experience.

## Part 6: Practical Tips and Available Resources

### 6.1. Creating Own Lessons

- Teachers are encouraged to create their own lessons based on Imopeksis principles, using any content and exercises.

### 6.2. Available Materials

### 6.3. Burnout

- The Imopeksis method helps prevent burnout.

# Summary

The Imopeksis methodology, presented by Tomasz Wilczewski and Marta, is a comprehensive approach to teaching that prioritizes child development – their skills, confidence, and social and emotional competencies. By moving away from traditional, control and assessment-based methods, and focusing on creating conditions for independent learning, collaboration, and creativity, Imopeksis offers teachers tools for creating engaging, effective, and satisfying lessons. Furthermore, this method also helps teachers avoid burnout and enjoy their work.`,
