  content: `# Introduction

In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski, through casual discussion and answering questions, expands on the key aspects of his methodology. He emphasizes the importance of independent learning, avoiding verbal violence, viewing situations from a child's perspective, and developing passion and internal motivation. He also discusses the developmental specifics of children in years 4-6, highlighting their needs and challenges.

## Part 1: Independent Learning and Decision-Making

### 1.1 Avoiding Verbal Violence

Wilczewski highlights the harm of "words of violence" in communication with children (e.g., "stop," "do," "don't say," "order"). He stresses that such words trigger negative reactions and hinder a child's development.

### 1.2 "Situation Thinking"

A key element of the Imopeksis methodology is "situation thinking." This means that a teacher/parent should analyze the situation from the perspective of:

- **Situation:** An objective assessment of what is happening.
- **Group:** How the situation affects the entire group.
- **Child:** How the situation is perceived by the specific child.

Only after such analysis can appropriate actions be taken. The teacher/parent should be "two, three steps back," observing and understanding, rather than imposing their solutions.

### 1.3 Avoiding Direct Confrontation

Wilczewski advises avoiding direct confrontation and judging the child. Instead, situations should be created where the child can reflect and make decisions independently.

### 1.4 Quiet Communication

Children are scared of the teachers. Communication with kids should be quiet.

## Part 2: The Role of Parents and Teachers – Supporting, Not Replacing

### 2.1 Not Imposing Norms

The child should have the opportunity to independently discover and shape their norms and values. Imposing ready-made solutions on the child hinders their development and leads to rebellion.

### 2.2 Listening and Observation

The key role of an adult is attentive listening and observation of the child. This allows for understanding their needs, motivations, and ways of thinking.

### 2.3 Referring Back to the Child

Instead of providing ready answers, the child should be referred back to themselves by asking questions that prompt reflection (e.g., "Do you think you did right or wrong?").

### 2.4 Avoiding Evaluation

Wilczewski criticizes the traditional grading system, which focuses on external evaluation rather than the internal sense of progress and self-improvement of the child.

### 2.5 Avoiding Praise

Praising is a form of prostitution.

## Part 3: Specifics of Child Development in Years 4-6

### 3.1 Sensitive Period

Wilczewski discusses the developmental specifics of children in years 4-6 (ages 9-12), highlighting:

- **Desire for Self-Improvement:** Children at this age are naturally motivated to develop and improve their skills.
- **Strong Sense of Self-Worth:** Children have a strong sense of self-worth, and any conflicts with authorities (teachers, parents) can lead to aggression.
- **Period of Negative Behaviours:** This is a natural stage of development that passes. It is important not to suppress these behaviours but to understand and respond to them appropriately.
- **Seeking Enemies:** Children may invent "enemies" and conflicts. This is also a natural part of development.
- **Antisocial Attitude:** Children may appear antisocial but simultaneously desire group belonging.
- **Tolerance:** This is a period where a high level of tolerance for the child's behaviours and emotions is necessary.
- **Honesty and Directness:** Children at this age are honest and direct, which can be utilized in the learning process.
- **Short-Lived Enthusiasm:** Children may show "short-lived enthusiasm," meaning a desire to engage in many different activities, but without consistency.

### 3.2 Managing Silence

Wilczewski emphasizes that the less the teacher speaks, the greater their authority. Silence and giving space to the child for independent thinking and action are crucial.

## Part 4: Passion, Dreams, and Overcoming Oneself

### 4.1 Role of Passion

Developing a child's passion is crucial for their motivation and sense of fulfillment. The teacher/parent should support the child in discovering and developing their interests.

### 4.2 Dreams and Goals

Having dreams and goals is important for a sense of purpose and direction in life. These can even be "silly" dreams; what matters is that they are personal.

### 4.3 Overcoming Oneself

The ability to overcome one's weaknesses, fears, and limitations is key to achieving success in life. Sport can be an excellent tool for developing this skill.

## Part 5: Communication with Parents and Summary

### 5.1 Avoiding Forcing Grades

Parents should not force teachers to give grades and information about the child's behaviour. Instead, they should focus on communication with the child themselves.

### 5.2 Parent-Child Cooperation

The most important aspect is communication and cooperation between the parent and the child. The child should teach the parent, not the other way around.

## Summary

The Imopeksis methodology, presented by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a holistic approach to education that prioritizes the child – their needs, emotions, way of thinking, and natural potential. By moving away from traditional methods based on compulsion, evaluation, and competition, and focusing on independence, reflection, collaboration, and developing passion, Imopeksis offers teachers and parents tools to support the full and harmonious development of the child. The key is understanding that the child is the teacher, and the adult is the student, who must learn from the child.
