    content: `# Introduction

In this section of the training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues discussing the Imopeksis methodology, focusing on technical periodization and the psychopedagogical aspects of basketball training. He explains how to structure training sessions to develop both the technical and cognitive skills of players, taking into account their individual needs and behavior models.

## Part 1: Training Structure – Phases and Cycles

### 1.1. The Three Phases of a Lesson (Recap)

- **Teaching**: Introducing new skills, focusing on technique and understanding movement.
- **Improving**: Developing skills in more complex situations, with elements of interaction and play.
- **Training**: Reinforcing skills through intensive training, engaging both the body and mind.

### 1.2. Duration of Phases

- The ideal time for each phase is about 9-10 minutes.
- Modifications are possible depending on the group's needs and training goals.

### 1.3. Training Cycles

- **Microcycle**: Typically lasts a week (e.g., 3 days of intensive training + 1 day of rest).
- **Macrocycle**: A longer period (e.g., several weeks, a month), considering changes in intensity and load.
- **Periodization**: Planning training with consideration of cycles, critical periods, and goals.

## Part 2: Practical Exercise Examples – Moving Without the Ball

### 2.1. Stations

Wilczewski proposes station exercises to teach and refine various elements of moving without the ball:

- **Basketball Stance**: Correct starting position.
- **Starts**: Different types of starts (left/right foot, from a standstill, from movement).
- **Acceleration of the Second and Third Step**: Key for bypassing an opponent.
- **Stops**: Different types of stops (one tempo, left-right, right-left, closeout).

#### Changes of Direction

- Through bounce.
- Through foot twist.
- Through balance (shoulder shift).
- Using pivot.

#### Changes of Pace

- From slow to fast.
- From fast to slow.
- Multiple pace changes.
- Changes of pace and direction.

### 2.2. "Guardians"

At each station, there is a "guardian" – a player responsible for demonstration and helping others. This promotes student-led learning and responsibility.

### 2.3. Exercise Modification

The coach and "guardians" can modify the exercises, for example:

- Focusing on specific technical elements (e.g., handwork, foot positioning).
- Changing the dynamics and space of movement.
- Adding challenges.

## Part 3: Improving – Integrating Skills into Play

### 3.1. Games and Play

Wilczewski suggests various games and play activities that integrate the learned elements of moving without the ball:

- **Enchanted Tag**: The tagged person performs a specific move, and release occurs by mimicking that move.
- **Tarantula**: A game where players must quickly change positions to avoid being "it".
- **3 on 2 with Neutral**: A game with a numerical advantage, forcing decision-making and cooperation.
- **Restricted Play**: E.g., counting only specific plays, playing with a set number of passes.
  - Game with forward passes.
  - Game with back and pass.

### 3.2. The Importance of Observation

The coach should carefully observe the players and adjust exercises to their needs and capabilities.

## Part 4: Neurodidactics and Psychopedagogy

### 4.1. Neurodidactics

It is important to teach through movement, emotion, learning, and relationships.

### 4.2. Psychopedagogy

Wilczewski highlights the importance of psychopedagogy, the combination of psychological and pedagogical knowledge, in a coach's work. The coach should understand:

- Players' intentions.
- Motivation.
- Confidence.
- Emotions.
- Concentration.
- Team cohesion.
- Intuition.

### 4.3. DISC Model

Wilczewski refers to the DISC model (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness) to illustrate how different personality types affect players' behavior and how to tailor communication and methods to them.

- Types of players (examples): Scorer, Playmaker.
- Types of personalities (examples): Hard Mind.

## Summary

This part of the Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, focuses on the practical aspects of basketball training, particularly on movement without the ball. Through a series of exercises, games, and play, Wilczewski demonstrates how to develop the technical, cognitive, and social skills of players while promoting independence, reflection, and cooperation. He emphasizes the importance of individualizing the approach, observing and adapting to the group's needs, and moving away from traditional, result-driven methods of training.`,
