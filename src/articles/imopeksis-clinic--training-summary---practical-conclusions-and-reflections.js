In this section of the training, Tomasz Wilczewski summarizes practical basketball training by discussing key aspects of the Imopeksis methodology and their application in working with young players. He analyzes mistakes, highlights strengths, and emphasizes the importance of continuous reflection, adaptation, and individualization of approach.

## Part 1: Reflections on Training – What Works and What Needs Improvement?

### 1.1. Training Organisation

- **Stations:** Initially, it was planned to use "guardians" at stations, but due to participants' unfamiliarity with the exercises, a joint demonstration and trainer-led approach was decided upon.
- **Intensity and Load:** Attention was drawn to the need to adjust intensity and load to the players' capabilities.
- **Communication:** The importance of clear and concise communication was emphasized, avoiding excessive chatter and focusing on specific guidance.
- **Peer Teaching:** The positive impact of peer learning was noted, where one player corrects and supports another.

### 1.2. Mistakes and Ways to Correct Them

- **Lack of Reflection:** Participants pointed out the lack of time for reflection and analysis of their own actions.
- **Excessive Control:** Too much control from the trainer can inhibit players' independence and creativity.
- **Misaligned Exercises:** Exercises need to be tailored to the skill level and needs of the players.
- **Lack of "Guardians":** Absence of an appropriate leader.

### 1.3. Positive Aspects

- **Player Engagement:** Players were engaged in the exercises and eager to learn.
- **Mutual Support:** Players supported each other and provided feedback.
- **Rapid Progress:** Despite initial difficulties, players quickly mastered new skills.

## Part 2: Key Principles of the Imopeksis Methodology – Review and Deepening

### 2.1. Three Phases of a Lesson

- **Teaching:** Introducing new skills.
- **Improvement:** Developing skills in more complex situations.
- **Training:** Reinforcing skills through intensive practice.

### 2.2. The Importance of Reflection

Reflection is crucial for the learning process. Players should analyze their actions, draw conclusions, and learn from mistakes.

### 2.3. Individualization of Approach

The trainer should adjust work methods to the individual needs and predispositions of each player.

### 2.4. Supporting, Not Replacing

The trainer should support, but not replace the players. They should create situations where players can make decisions independently and take responsibility.

### 2.5. Avoiding "Words of Violence"

Avoid using words that express command, compulsion, criticism, judgment, or comparison.

### 2.6. Communication

Speak to players softly, calmly, and respectfully. Ask questions rather than giving commands. Listen to and understand the players.

### 2.7. Providing Space

Players need space to think, act independently, and make mistakes.

### 2.8. The Importance of Emotions

Emotions help in remembering an event.

## Part 3: Practical Tips for Trainers

### 3.1. Observation

The trainer should carefully observe players during training to adjust exercises to their needs and capabilities.

### 3.2. Adaptation

The trainer should be flexible and modify exercises depending on how players cope with them.

### 3.3. Communication

The trainer should communicate clearly and concisely with players, providing them with specific guidance and feedback.

### 3.4. Peer Teaching

The trainer should encourage players to learn from and support each other.

### 3.5. Creating a Positive Atmosphere

The trainer should ensure a positive atmosphere during training that fosters learning and development.

### 3.6. Examples from Training

Trainers share examples.
