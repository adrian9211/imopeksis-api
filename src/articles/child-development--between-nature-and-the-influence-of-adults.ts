The training session held on 18th February 2024 in Łomża addressed key issues concerning the development of children and adolescents, focusing on the differences between a child's and an adult's perspective. The speaker, Tomasz Wilczewski, based on years of experience working with young people (around 5000 children annually), presented conclusions drawn from observations, scientific research, and personal insights. The main aim was to make teachers and parents aware of how their actions and expectations shape the younger generation.

## Part 1: Understanding the Child – Neurological and Psychological Perspective

### 1.1. Prematurity and Brain Development

- All humans are born premature, which means our brain develops intensively after birth.
- By the age of 5, we reach the full potential of neuronal connections, making this period crucial for the development of creativity and cognitive abilities.
- Unfortunately, the education system, instead of supporting this potential, often limits it.
- NASA studies have shown a drastic decline in creativity among school-age children: from 98% in five-year-olds to just 12% in fifteen-year-olds.

### 1.2. Egocentrism versus Empathy

- Children up to the age of 7 do not understand another person's perspective. This is not a lack of empathy but a developmental trait.
- Children are empathetic and willing to share, but they cannot connect their actions with the feelings of others.

### 1.3. Period of Rebellion (13-16 years)

- The period between the ages of 13 and 16 is naturally a time for negative behaviours and experimentation.
- Children test boundaries, and parents, especially mothers, become "emotional punching bags."
- If this period is suppressed by strict upbringing, it may resurface later with double strength, for example, during university years.

### 1.4. The Role of Grandmothers – Sensory Neurons

- After the age of 50, sensory neurons form in the brain, allowing better understanding of others' emotions.
- This is why grandmothers often have a better rapport with grandchildren and can sense their needs.

## Part 2: Child's Needs – Play, Movement, Relationships and Imperialism

### 2.1. What Motivates a Child?

Contrary to common beliefs, competition and results are not the most important for children. What matters more are:

- **Movement:** Children have a natural need for movement, which is linked to cognitive curiosity. Restricting movement hinders development.
- **Play:** Play is not just entertainment but also a way to learn and express emotions. Children need to play with others – parents, peers.
- **Relationships:** Children attend school mainly for contact with other children. Relationships are key to their social development. The "child teaches child" method is often more effective than traditional adult teaching.
- **Imperialism (in the context of a child):** This is the natural desire to learn, acquire skills, and understand oneself. A child wants to do things independently rather than being replaced by adults.

### 2.2. Reflection – The Key to Learning

- Reflection, meaning the contemplation and analysis of one's experiences, is essential for learning.
- Children need time for reflection after school or training. Forcing them to immediately share their impressions is a mistake.
- Lack of reflection leads to repeating the same mistakes.

### 2.3. Emotions

- A child in emotions does not hear.
- Women experience emotions twice as intensely as men.

## Part 3: The Influence of Adults – Mistakes and Opportunities

### 3.1. Pedagogy of Fear

- The education system often relies on fear, humiliation, and criticism. Instead of supporting development, it hinders it.
- Children learn to avoid mistakes instead of learning from them.

### 3.2. Excessive Praise and Replacement

- A common mistake by parents is praising the child for everything and doing tasks for them.
- This leads to dependence on praise and a lack of independence. A child loses the ability for self-reward and gratitude.
- Recognition should be used instead of praise.

### 3.3. Rat Race

- Exploiting parents' resources to meet coaches' needs.

### 3.4. Autonomy and Learning

- Poles have a strong need for autonomy. We want to learn, but we do not want to be taught.
- Therefore, traditional teaching methods are often ineffective. Children must experience and feel for themselves to learn.

### 3.5. The Role of Sport

- Sport develops physical skills but also cognitive abilities.

## Part 4: Behaviour Models (Extended DISC)

### 4.1. Four Personality Types

The speaker presented the Extended DISC model, dividing people into four main behaviour types:

- **D (Dominant):** Confident, controlling, goal-oriented. Treats others condescendingly.
- **I (Inspiring):** Sociable, open, creative. Treats others as friends.
- **S (Supportive):** Stable, conscientious, dislikes change. Team is important to them.
- **C (Analytical):** Precise, detailed, analytical. Needs information.

### 4.2. Importance of Models in Relationships

- Understanding behaviour models aids in communication and building relationships.
- Each model has its strengths and weaknesses. It is important to accept differences and adjust communication to the personality type.

## Summary

Child development is a complex process influenced by both natural factors (genetics, brain development) and environmental factors (upbringing, education, relationships). To support the development of the younger generation, adults must understand the child's perspective, needs, and way of thinking. It is crucial to move away from the pedagogy of fear and excessive control towards supporting autonomy, reflection, play, and relationships. Understanding behaviour models (Extended DISC) can help build better communication and more effectively support children's development. The role of sport is important, as it develops both physical and cognitive skills.`,
