    content: `# Introduction

In this segment of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues his presentation for parents, elaborating on the hierarchical model of psychosocial competence development. He thoroughly discusses the individual stages of this model (knowledge, skill, competence, value, culture, transcendence), emphasizing the significance of the ages 5-9 as a critical period for shaping these competences. He presents practical tips and examples on how to support a child's natural development, avoiding the pitfalls of traditional upbringing.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in upbringing and education. By understanding child psychology, their needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools for creating an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is autonomy, reflection, cooperation, moderation, developing passions, and adapting communication and work methods to the individual characteristics of each child. Parents and teachers play a crucial role in this process, supporting the child without replacing them, giving them space for independent thinking and action, and teaching them gratitude, responsibility, and respect for themselves and others.`,
