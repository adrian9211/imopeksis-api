    content: `# Introduction

In this section of the training, Tomasz Wilczewski, a representative of Imopeksis, focuses on the method used with athletes at Imopeksis. A key aspect of this philosophy is moving away from the traditional, authoritarian coaching model, which is based on imposing commands and assessing results, towards building a team "from within" by developing athletes' internal motivation, self-confidence, concentration, cohesion, and intuition.

## Part 1: Imopeksis Philosophy – Listening and Understanding

### 1.1. Shadow Module and Imopeksis Approach

Wilczewski refers to the "shadow module" (likely a concept from previous training sessions), which focuses on the negative aspects of personality and behavior. The Imopeksis approach aims to eliminate these "flaws" by developing positive traits.

### 1.2. Key Elements of the Imopeksis Method

- **Intentions:** Understanding the intentions of athletes (positive, negative, indifferent) through attentive listening, emotional resilience, and acknowledging the partner's perspective.
- **Motivation:** Focusing on intrinsic motivation, derived from progress and independent experience, rather than extrinsic motivation (rewards, praise).
- **Feelings:** It is important for the athlete to experience and feel.
- **Self-confidence:** Building self-confidence through developing competencies (skills applied in practice), overcoming negative thoughts, and gathering experiences in match tests (focused on causes, not effects).
- **Emotions:** Teaching athletes to identify emotions.
- **Concentration and Cohesion:** Achieving concentration by setting small, realistic tasks and developing team cohesion through mutual understanding, tolerance, and cooperation.

## Part 2: Building Self-Confidence

### 2.1. Competence vs Skills

- **Skill:** Mastering a particular movement or action.
- **Competence:** The skill effectively applied in a challenging situation. Building self-confidence is based on developing competence.

### 2.2. Overcoming Negative Thoughts

Negative thoughts have a strong impact on the subconscious. It is crucial to consciously reject negative emotions and focus on positive aspects.

### 2.3. Match Tests

A match is not just about the result, but primarily a test of skills. An athlete should evaluate the causes of their actions (e.g., how many times they performed a specific move, how many times they made a good decision), not just the outcomes (e.g., how many points they scored).

### 2.4. Belief in the Athlete

A coach should demonstrate belief in the athlete, even (or especially) in difficult moments. Avoiding "punitive substitutions" after a failed play is key to building self-confidence.

## Part 3: Concentration and Task-oriented Thinking

### 3.1. Small Tasks

Concentration is based on task-oriented thinking. Instead of setting general goals for athletes ("play well"), they should be given small, specific tasks (e.g., "make three successful passes in this quarter").

### 3.2. Maintaining Uncertainty

A slight uncertainty about task completion motivates and strengthens concentration. Tasks should be ambitious but realistic.

### 3.3. Constructive Self-criticism

An athlete should analyze their actions and draw conclusions, focusing on the causes rather than just the effects.

## Part 4: Team Cohesion – Building Relationships

### 4.1. Individual Significance

Every athlete should understand their individual significance to the team, as well as the significance of other players. This builds mutual understanding and respect.

### 4.2. Getting to Know Partners

Players should get to know each other during the game by observing each other's strengths and weaknesses.

### 4.3. Co-realisation and Tolerance

Team cohesion is based on mutual tolerance, acceptance of flaws, and focusing on positive traits. It is important for players to support each other and jointly pursue goals.

### 4.4. Difference between Coach and Trainer

- **Coach:** The name from players to the trainer.
- **Trainer:** The name from the trainer to the player.

## Part 5: Intuition – The Effect of Cohesion

### 5.1. Intuitive Actions

When a team is cohesive, and players have a high level of self-confidence and concentration, intuitive actions arise from mutual understanding and trust.

## Summary

The Imopeksis philosophy, represented by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a holistic approach to training that goes beyond traditional frameworks. The key to success is building a team "from within," by developing athletes' internal motivation, self-confidence, concentration, cohesion, and intuition. The coach, rather than being a dictator, becomes a mentor and guide who supports the development of individual talents and builds strong relationships within the team. It is important to understand the difference between a coach and a trainer.`,
