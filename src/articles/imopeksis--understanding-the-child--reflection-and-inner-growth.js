    content: `# Introduction

In this segment of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues his in-depth analysis of the differences between the perspectives of children and adults, emphasizing the importance of reflection, internal motivation, and independent learning. He provides practical advice on how to support a child's development while avoiding traditional methods of education that rely on coercion and evaluation.

## Part 1: Children vs Adults – Fundamental Differences

### 1.1. Lack of Common Ground

- Wilczewski begins by stating that adults and children do not share a common ground in their perception of the world and learning process.
- Adults, due to their experiences and fixed thought patterns, often fail to understand how a child thinks and feels, leading to communication and upbringing errors.

### 1.2. Neurobiological Differences

- **Child's Brain**: It is in a phase of intense development, characterized by high plasticity and learning capacity.
- **Adult's Brain**: It is already formed, making it harder for adults to understand a child's perspective.

### 1.3. Prematurity

- Everyone is born prematurely, meaning the brain develops mostly after birth.

## Part 2: Methodical and Didactic Influence – The Key to Effective Teaching

### 2.1. Child as a "Reflection"

- A child mirrors the influences of their environment (parents, teachers, trainers) like a mirror. Therefore, it is crucial what influences we exert on the child.

### 2.2. Methodical Influence

- What we give to the child (e.g., play, game, exercise).
- The child responds to this influence through emotions, movement, engagement.

### 2.3. Didactic Influence

- How we convey something (e.g., words, tone of voice, attitude).
- It is often ineffective or even harmful if based on coercion, criticism, evaluation, or comparison.

### 2.4. Psychopedagogy

- The combination of psychology and pedagogy knowledge, allowing for understanding the child's needs and adapting teaching methods to their individual capabilities.

### 2.5. Authority

- Authority is not a position or title but the ability to influence. The greater and more positive the influence, the greater the authority.

## Part 3: Child's Needs – Movement, Emotions, Learning, Relationships

### 3.1. Four Pillars

Wilczewski identifies four basic needs of the child:

- **Movement**: A natural need for movement, linked with cognitive curiosity and building self-trust.
- **Emotions**: Children need to experience all emotions, not just positive ones.
- **Learning (Imperialism)**: An internal need for learning, acquiring skills, and self-discovery.
- **Relationships**: Children need contact with other children (especially of different ages).
- **Institutionalism**: A child needs to feel a sense of belonging.

### 3.2. Play vs Exercise

- **Play**: A form of activity that engages emotions, develops creativity, and allows for independent action.
- **Exercise**: A form of activity where the child performs specific tasks, often imposed by an adult.

### 3.3. Outcome

- **Child's Perspective**: The outcome is individual progress, satisfaction with one's achievements.
- **Adult's Perspective**: The outcome is often a result, comparison with others, evaluation.

### 3.4. Competition

- **True Meaning**: Competition is about becoming new, developing through interaction with others.
- **Misunderstanding**: Competition is often seen as a desire to outdo others, to prove one's superiority.

## Part 4: Reflection and Inner Growth – The Key to Sustainable Learning

### 4.1. Importance of Reflection

- The most important element of the learning process is reflection – thinking over and analyzing one's experiences. It is in reflection, not during the activity itself, that lasting knowledge and skills are consolidated.

### 4.2. Avoiding Evaluation and Comparison

- Evaluation, opinion, comparison, and criticism from adults interrupt the reflection process and inhibit a child's development.

### 4.3. Independence and Responsibility

- Children should be given as much independence and responsibility as possible. Allow them to make decisions, make mistakes, and learn from their own experiences.

### 4.4. Self-Realisation

- A child must have the opportunity for self-realisation.

### 4.5. Self-Praise

- Instead of external praise, children should be taught self-praise and gratitude. A child should be able to appreciate their own achievements and be grateful for what they have.

## Part 5: Social Competence – Shaping Attitudes

### 5.1. Knowledge, Skill, Competence, Value

Wilczewski presents a hierarchical model of social competence development:

- **Knowledge**: Basic information about a given competence.
- **Skill**: The ability to apply knowledge in practice.
- **Competence**: A lasting habit, agency in action.
- **Value**: A deep, internal conviction of the correctness of a given competence.

### 5.2. Higher Levels

Above value are:

- **Individual Culture**: The person becomes a role model.
- **Team Culture**: A group of people guided by common values.
- **Social Culture**: The influence of the individual and group on society.
- **Transcendence**: A level of spiritual connection, dedication to a higher purpose.

### 5.3. Cognitive Curiosity

- A child's natural curiosity is the driving force of their development. Adults should support this curiosity, not suppress it.

### 5.4. Responsibility

- Responsibility is a key competence that allows a child to make independent decisions, face consequences, and learn from their own mistakes.

### 5.5. Moderation

- Moderation is the path to happiness.

## Part 6: Practical Examples and Discussion

### 6.1. The "Robot" Exercise

- **Purpose**: To demonstrate how to create a learning environment that engages children and fosters their development.
- **Method**: The exercise involves a series of stations where children practice different "robot" movements, led by "guardians" (student leaders). The exercise progresses from simple individual movements to more complex combinations and group interactions.

**Key Principles**:

- Student-led learning.
- Progression from simple to complex.
- Integration of movement qualities.
- Adaptation to individual needs.
- Use of games and play.
- Emphasis on reflection and self-awareness.

### 6.2. The "Baba Jaga" Game

- The game is used to develop a cognitive ability.

### 6.3. Discussion with Participants

- Wilczewski engages in discussions with the participants, answering their questions and addressing their concerns.
- He emphasizes the importance of understanding children's perspectives and adapting teaching methods accordingly.
- He critiques traditional approaches that focus on external rewards, competition, and judgment.
- He highlights the need for teachers to be flexible, adaptable, and reflective.
- He encourages participants to experiment with the Imopeksis methodology and to learn from their own experiences.`,
