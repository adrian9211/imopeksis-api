In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski delves into a more detailed discussion of the practical aspects of the methodology, focusing on developing social competencies, the learning process, and the role of reflection and independence. He uses numerous examples and anecdotes to illustrate his points and encourage participants to think and act actively.

## Part 1: Social Competencies – Hierarchy of Development

### 1.1. Levels of Competency

Wilczewski presents a hierarchical model for the development of social competencies:

- **Knowledge**: Basic information about a given competency.
- **Skill**: The ability to apply knowledge in practice.
- **Competency**: A permanent habit, agency in action.
- **Value**: A deep, intrinsic belief in the validity of the competency.
- **Individual Culture**: A role model.
- **Team Culture**: A group of people guided by common values.
- **Social Culture**: The influence of individuals and groups on society.
- **Transcendence**: A level of spiritual connection.

Stepping back as an adult and allowing the child to make independent decisions.

### 3.2. Decision, Risk, Responsibility

- **Teaching**: Introducing new skills.
- **Improving**: Developing skills in more complex situations.
- **Training**: Reinforcing skills through intensive training.

### 7.5. The Teacher’s Role

The teacher should be a facilitator, observer, adaptor, not a dictator.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call for a paradigm shift in education and upbringing. By moving away from traditional methods and focusing on understanding child psychology, their needs, and natural dispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key lies in independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, nurturing passion, and adapting communication and working methods to each child's individual characteristics.`,
