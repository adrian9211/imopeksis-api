    content: `# Introduction

In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski focuses on social competences and their crucial role in the development of young people. He presents a hierarchical model of development that progresses from knowledge and skills, through competences and values, to culture (individual, team, and social) and transcendence. He emphasizes the importance of the ages 5-9 as a critical period for shaping these competences.

## Part 1: Hierarchical Model of Competence Development

### 1.1. Knowledge

- The foundation is knowledge, conveyed to the child by conscious adults.
- It is important that this knowledge is shared in a manner that encourages independent thinking.

### 1.2. Skill

- The child must have the opportunity to apply knowledge practically, make mistakes, and learn from them.

### 1.3. Competence

- Through repetition and refinement, the child develops competences – lasting habits and agency in action.
- Competence is the ability to apply knowledge in new situations.

### 1.4. Value

- Value is a deep conviction about the rightness of a given competence, the level of selflessness from which actions stem from an inner need.

### 1.5. Higher Levels

- **Individual Culture:** The person becomes a role model.
- **Team Culture:** A group of people guided by shared values.
- **Social Culture:** The influence of the individual and group on society.
- **Transcendence:** A level of spiritual connection, dedication to a higher purpose.

## Part 2: Key Social Competences (5-9 years)

### 2.1. Cognitive Curiosity

- A child's natural curiosity is the driving force of their development.
- Adults should support this curiosity rather than suppress it (e.g., through prohibitions).
- Movement is a primary tool for a child to explore the world.
- The ages 10-12 are a time of heightened curiosity ("flash in the pan").
- Research indicates a decline in creativity with age due to adult pressure and the educational system.

### 2.2. Responsibility

- "Re-sponsibility" – stepping back and allowing the child to make decisions independently and face the consequences.
- Decision, risk, responsibility – three inseparable elements.
- Avoid advising and doing things for the child.
- Support, not substitution – discreetly supporting the child.

### 2.3. Moderation

- Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has.
- Research indicates a link between moderation and happiness.
- External pressure (social expectations) and internal (perfectionism) can lead to frustration.

### 2.4. Gratitude

- A key social competence.
- Children are naturally grateful, but adults often suppress this trait.

### 2.5. Empathy and Emotional Intelligence

- Children have a natural ability for empathy.

### 2.6. Self-improvement

- Children have a natural need for self-improvement and learning.

### 2.7. Defence of Autonomy

- Children have a strong need to defend their autonomy and independence.

## Part 3: Examples and Practical Application

### 3.1. Life Examples

- Wilczewski provides numerous examples from everyday life and sports, illustrating how to foster social competences in children (e.g., preparing birthday gifts, responding to failure, communicating with the child).

### 3.2. Importance of Reflection

- True learning occurs after the lesson/training, in the process of reflection.

### 3.3. Three Phases of a Lesson (Imopeksis)

- **Teaching:** Introducing new skills.
- **Improvement:** Developing skills in more complex situations.
- **Training:** Reinforcing skills through intensive practice.

### 3.4. Role of the Teacher/Parent

- The teacher/parent should be a facilitator, observer, adaptor, not a dictator.

### 3.5. Avoiding "Words of Violence"

- Avoid words expressing orders, compulsion, criticism, judgment, or comparison.

### 3.6. Communication

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.
- Ask questions rather than giving commands.
- Listen to and understand the child.

### 3.7. Providing Space

- The child needs space for independent thinking, action, and making mistakes.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, conducted by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call for a paradigm shift in upbringing and education. By understanding the psychology of children, their needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools for creating an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, and developing passions, as well as adapting communication and working methods to the individual characteristics of each child.`,
