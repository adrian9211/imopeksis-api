    content: `# Introduction

In this section of the training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues to present the Imopeksis methodology, focusing on technical periodisation in basketball training. He discusses the training structure, exercise progression, and the importance of various phases (teaching, refining, training) for player development. He emphasizes the importance of individualizing the approach, observing and adapting to group needs, and avoiding traditional errors in training.

# Part 1: Training Structure and Development Phases

## 1.1. Three Lesson Phases

- **Teaching**: Introduction of new skills, focusing on technique and movement understanding.
- **Refining**: Developing skills in more complex situations, with elements of interaction and play.
- **Training**: Consolidating skills through intensive training, engaging both the body and mind.

## 1.2. Periodisation

Wilczewski presents the concept of periodisation, which involves planning training over a longer period, considering cycles and development phases.

## 1.3. Importance of the Brain

He highlights the role of the brain in the learning and development process, pointing out the importance of its different parts (left and right hemispheres, front and back, top and bottom) in various training phases.

# Part 2: Practical Exercises – Special Passes

## 2.1. Passing Stations

Training begins with exercises at stations where players learn different types of special passes:

- Fake pass: Using a twist of the torso and specific arm movements.
- Strong pass from stance: Quick and powerful two-handed pass.
- Overhead and underhand pass (and vice versa): Changing the pass level.
- Short overhead pass: Dynamic movement from behind the head.
- Underhand to overhead pass (and vice versa): From a low position.
- Pass with trailing/leading leg: Various pass variants using leg positions.
- Dribble pass.
- Jump pass.
- "Goalkeeper" pass.
- One-handed pass after dribble, behind the back.

## 2.2. "Guardians"

At each station, there is a "guardian" – a player responsible for demonstration and assisting others.

## 2.3. Rotation and Modification

Players rotate between stations, with the coach and "guardians" introducing exercise modifications.

# Part 3: Refining – Applying Passes in Play

## 3.1. 3 on 1 Game ("Piggy in the Middle")

Passing exercise in a numerical advantage situation.

## 3.2. Game Modifications

- Adding goals (e.g., passing between players for two points).
- Limiting the number of passes.
- Changing the rules.

## 3.3. Other Games and Exercises

# Part 4: Training – Intensification and Consolidation

## 4.1. Increasing Intensity

Introducing high-intensity and complex exercises to consolidate skills and develop cognitive abilities.

## 4.2. Exercise Examples

- Running with passes and direction changes.
- Games with restrictions (e.g., only certain types of passes).
- Exercises with elements of competition (but not based on score, rather on completing specific tasks).

# Part 5: Importance of Observation and Adaptation

## 5.1. Observing Players' Behaviours

The coach should closely observe players to tailor the training to their individual needs and capabilities.

## 5.2. Adapting Exercises

The coach should be flexible and modify exercises depending on how players are coping.

## 5.3. Reflection

Reflection is crucial for the learning process.

# Part 6: Errors in Traditional Training

Wilczewski criticizes errors.

# Summary

This section of Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, focuses on the practical application of the methodology in basketball training, specifically on special passes. Through a series of exercises, from simple stations to complex games, Wilczewski demonstrates how to gradually increase difficulty, engage players, and develop their technical, cognitive, and social skills. He emphasizes the importance of observation, adaptation, reflection, and continuous improvement, both from the players and the coach.`,
