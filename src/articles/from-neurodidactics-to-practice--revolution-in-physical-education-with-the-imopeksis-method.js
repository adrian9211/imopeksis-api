In this segment of the Imopeksis training, held in Łódź on 14 January 2024, Tomasz Wilczewski, a lecturer, trainer, educator, and former athlete, presents a revolutionary approach to physical education based on neurodidactics and a deep understanding of child development. The training, organised in collaboration with PSP No. 31 in Radom, aims to inspire teachers and trainers to change the way lessons are conducted, in order to support children's natural potential rather than suppress it.

## Part 1: Critique of the Traditional System and the Need for Change

### 1.1. Underestimation of Teachers and Neurobiology

Wilczewski begins with the provocative statement that early childhood education teachers should earn significantly more, but only if their teaching methods are based on knowledge of the neurobiological development of children. He emphasises that the contemporary education system largely ignores this knowledge, leading to ineffective teaching and frustration among both students and teachers. Adults cannot understand and even remember how a child's brain works.

### 1.2. Development Priorities

Wilczewski stresses that the priority should be the development of social competences and the cognitive system (nervous system efficiency), with physical activity coming afterwards.

### 1.3. Ideal Sportsman/Person Model

The model should include these parts:

- Moral part.
- Ethical part.
- Intellectual part.
- Program basics.
- Physical part.

## Part 2: Reflection and Influence – The Key to Learning

### 2.1. The Child as a "Reflection"

A child learns not only through exercises but primarily through reflecting on their experiences. They mirror the influences of their environment (parents, teachers, peers) like a mirror. Hence, the influences we exert on the child are crucial.

### 2.2. Methodical and Didactic Influence

- **Methodical Influence:** What we give the child (e.g., play, games, exercises).
- **Didactic Influence:** How we convey something (e.g., words, tone of voice, attitude).
- **Intervention (Psychological):** Additional actions taken to correct negative behaviours or support development.

### 2.3. Authority

Authority is not a position or title, but the ability to exert influence. The greater and more positive the influence, the greater the authority.

### 2.4. Psychopedagogy

The connections between psychology and pedagogy.

### 2.5. Negative Effects of Traditional Methods

Wilczewski criticises traditional teaching methods based on:

- **Humiliation and Contempt:** "How are you sitting?", "Why are you late?"
- **Threatening:** "Do that again, and you'll see."
- **Explaining:** "I've explained it to you so many times."
- **Judging and Comparing:** "Everyone is sitting properly, only you can't."

Such methods lead to negative reactions in children, such as rebellion, aggression, withdrawal, and in the long run – a lack of motivation and relationship problems.

### 2.6. Lack of Physiological Reflection

Modern parents, driven by excessive care, often do not allow children to experience basic physiological reflection (e.g., feeling hunger), which negatively impacts their development.

## Part 3: Child's Needs and Imopeksis Methodology

### 3.1. Key Needs of the Child

Wilczewski lists the key needs of the child that should be met in the education process:

- **Relationships:** Children need contact with other children (especially of different ages).
- **Movement:** A natural need for movement, linked with cognitive curiosity and building self-trust.
- **Play:** Not just entertainment, but also a way to learn, express emotions, and develop social competences.
- **Imperialism (Self-Development):** An internal need to learn, acquire skills, and understand oneself.
- **Outcome:** But not an outcome in terms of competition and comparison with others, rather an individual outcome reflecting progress and satisfaction with one's achievements.
- **Institutionalism:** Feeling of belonging.

### 3.2. Stages of Child's Growth

- **One-month-old child:** Small brain connections.
- **Five-year-old:** Genius.
- **Fourteen-year-old:** End of neuroplastic development of the brain.

### 3.3 Developmental Periods

- **5-9 years:** Social competences.
- **9-12 years:** Cognitive development.
- **14 years:** Physical growth.

### 3.4. Egocentrism and Cooperation

Up to the age of 12, a child is focused on themselves (egocentrism) and gathers information about themselves. Only later does the ability to cooperate and consider others' perspectives develop.

### 3.5. Emotions

Emotions are a natural and important part of a child's development. Children need to experience all emotions, not just the positive ones.

### 3.6. Internal Dialogue

Children need internal dialogue to feel emotions.

## Part 4: Practical Application of Imopeksis Methodology

### 4.1. Three Phases of a Lesson

Wilczewski presents three phases of a lesson, based on neurodidactics:

- **Teaching:** Introducing new skills through simple, logically connected exercises (e.g., stations/circuits). The teacher plays a supportive role.
- **Improving:** Developing skills in more complex situations (e.g., movement games). The teacher plays a creative role.
- **Training:** Consolidating skills through intensive training, engaging both body and mind. The teacher acts as an executor (not in an authoritarian sense, but as someone who sets challenges and monitors progress).

### 4.2. The Importance of Play

Play is a key element of the Imopeksis methodology. It allows for:

- Developing creativity and independence.
- Expressing emotions.
- Building relationships.
- Learning through experience.

### 4.3. The Role of the Teacher

In the Imopeksis methodology, the teacher is not a dictator, but:

- **An Observer:** Carefully observes children, their behaviours, reactions, and progress.
- **A Moderator:** Adjusts exercises and games to the needs and capabilities of the children.
- **A Supporter:** Helps, but does not do things for the children. Encourages, but does not force.
- **A Creator:** Creates an environment conducive to learning and development.

### 4.4. Social Competences

The Imopeksis methodology develops a range of social competences in children, such as:

- Responsibility.
- Communication.
- Cooperation.
- Moderation.
- Empathy.
- Gratitude.

## Part 5: Call to Action and Conclusion

### 5.1. Reflection and Self-awareness

Reflection is the key to learning.

## Conclusion

The training conducted by Tomasz Wilczewski presents a revolutionary approach to physical education and education in general. The Imopeksis methodology, based on neurodidactics and a deep understanding of children's needs, aims to create an environment where children can develop their full potential – physically, mentally, and socially. The key is moving away from traditional methods based on control, evaluation, and competition, towards supporting independence, creativity, reflection, and cooperation.`,
