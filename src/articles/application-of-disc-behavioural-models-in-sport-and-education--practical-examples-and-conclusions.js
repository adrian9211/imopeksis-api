# Introduction

In this segment of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues discussing the DISC model, focusing on practical examples of its application in sports, education, and interpersonal relationships. He analyzes how different DISC types (Dominance, Initiative, Steadiness, Conscientiousness) interact, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to adapt communication and work methods to each type.

## Part 1: DISC Model â€“ In-depth Analysis and Examples

### 1.1. Reminder of DISC Types

Wilczewski reminds us of the characteristics of the four basic DISC types:

- **D (Dominant):** Confident, decisive, goal-oriented, controlling.
- **I (Inspiring):** Sociable, open, enthusiastic, creative.
- **S (Supportive):** Calm, stable, diligent, loyal, empathetic.
- **C (Analytical):** Accurate, precise, analytical, logical.

### 1.2. DISC Type Combinations

Wilczewski explains that most people have a profile consisting of two dominant types, usually adjacent on the DISC chart (e.g., DI, SC). Opposing profiles (e.g., DC, IS) are less common.

### 1.3. Examples of DISC Profiles

- **Tough Mind (CD):** A person combining dominance and analytical traits. Difficult to work with, as they are convinced of their correctness and rely on facts and data.
- **Scorer (Extreme D):** Ruthless, goal-oriented, individualistic.
- **Playmaker (CS):** Diligent, precise, well-trained, but may lack initiative and spontaneity.
- **Showman (Extreme I):** Extroverted, sociable, enjoys being the center of attention.
- **Heart (SI):** Empathetic, supportive, a good leader, capable of inspiring others.
- **Grit Worker (Extreme S):** A person for the "dirty work," ready to make sacrifices, reliable but may lack self-confidence.
- **Lone Wolf (Extreme C):** An expert in their field, analytical, but may struggle with communication and collaboration.
- **Strict Father (DS):** Combines demands and discipline with support and care.
- **Mediator (IC):** A person who combines communication and empathy with an analytical approach.

### 1.4. Real-life and Sports Examples

Wilczewski provides numerous examples.

## Part 2: Practical Application of DISC Models

### 2.1. Team Dynamics

Wilczewski analyzes how different combinations of DISC types affect team dynamics:

- **4 x D:** Initial successes, but later conflicts and lack of cooperation.
- **4 x I:** Lots of fun, but lack of focus on the goal.
- **4 x S:** Stability, good defense, but lack of initiative.
- **4 x C:** Thorough analysis, but difficulties in making quick decisions.

### 2.2. Individualizing Approach

Understanding the DISC model allows for:

- **Adapting Communication:** Communicate differently with a D person than with an S person.
- **Adapting Tasks:** Different tasks will be suitable for an I person compared to a C person.
- **Motivating:** Each type is motivated differently.
- **Team Building:** Assigning tasks according to individuals' predispositions.

### 2.3. Communication with Specific Types

- **D:** Be specific, direct, and straightforward. Acknowledge their point of view but present alternatives.
- **I:** Create a friendly atmosphere, allow the expression of emotions and ideas, avoid criticism.
- **S:** Provide a sense of security, stability, avoid sudden changes, give clear instructions.
- **C:** Provide data, facts, analyses, avoid generalities, be precise.

### 2.4. On-field Situations

Wilczewski explains the importance of understanding players' DISC profiles to make effective substitutions and strategic decisions during a game.

## Part 3: Summary and Reflections

### 3.1. Importance of Self-awareness

Understanding one's own DISC model is crucial for effective work and communication with others.

### 3.2. Flexibility and Adaptation

Coaches, teachers, and parents should be flexible and adapt their working methods to the individual needs and predispositions of children.

### 3.3. Challenges of Modern Education

Wilczewski criticizes the traditional education system for not considering individual differences and not supporting the development of children's natural talents.

### 3.4. Role of Imopeksis

The Imopeksis methodology offers tools and strategies that allow for an individualized approach, building strong teams, and supporting children's development according to their natural predispositions.

## Summary

This segment of the Imopeksis training provides an in-depth analysis of DISC behavioral models and their practical application in sports, education, and interpersonal relationships. Tomasz Wilczewski, drawing on his extensive experience, demonstrates how understanding these models can aid in building stronger teams, more effective communication, and supporting the development of each child's individual potential. He emphasizes the importance of flexibility, adaptation, and continuous reflection on one's working methods.`,
