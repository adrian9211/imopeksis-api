    content: `# Introduction

In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski delves deeper into the discussion of the key principles of the methodology, emphasizing reflection, independence, and understanding of the child. He explains how traditional teaching methods often failed because they did not take into account the natural processes of learning and child development. He highlights the importance of creating an environment where a child can independently experience, make mistakes, and draw conclusions.

## Part 1: The Importance of Reflection in the Learning Process

### 1.1. The Lesson Lasts Longer than 45 Minutes

Wilczewski emphasizes that true learning does not occur during the lesson, but afterwards, in the process of reflection. A child needs time to process information, integrating it with their knowledge and experience. Therefore, the effect of a lesson may only be visible after several days or even weeks.

### 1.2. Avoiding Immediate Assessment

Teachers and parents often make the mistake of expecting immediate results and assessing the child right after completing a task. This interrupts the reflection process and hampers the child's development.

### 1.3. "Foolish for Not Attending Training"

Example of the sentence in a sports context.

## Part 2: The Three Phases of a Lesson – Teaching, Perfecting, Training

### 2.1. Teaching

- **Objective:** Introducing new skills in a logical and organized manner.
- **Method:** Stations (circuits) with simple exercises, "monitors" (student-leaders).
- **Role of the Teacher:** Supportive – helping with understanding, giving guidance, but not imposing solutions.

### 2.2. Perfecting

- **Objective:** Developing skills in more complex situations, with elements of interaction and play.
- **Method:** Movement games, combining movements, working in pairs/groups.
- **Role of the Teacher:** Creative – introducing tasks, modifying rules, observing and adapting.

### 2.3. Training

- **Objective:** Consolidating skills through intensive training, engaging both body and mind.
- **Method:** High-intensity and complex exercises, limited time, psychological pressure (but internal, not imposed by the teacher).
- **Role of the Teacher:** Enforcing (but not through criticism, rather by setting challenges and monitoring progress), observing, adjusting workload.

### 2.4. Examples and Metaphors

Examples with:
- Wave
- Shaking
- Swing
- Pose

## Part 3: Social Competence and Child Development

### 3.1. Child as a "Reflection"

A child reflects the influences of their environment like a mirror. Therefore, it is crucial what influences we exert on the child.

### 3.2. "Words of Violence"

Avoid words expressing command, compulsion, criticism, assessment, or comparison.

### 3.3. Independence and Responsibility

Children should be given as much independence and responsibility as possible. Allow them to make decisions, make mistakes, and learn from their own experiences.

### 3.4. Cognitive Curiosity

A child's natural curiosity is the driving force of their development. Adults should support this curiosity, not suppress it.

### 3.5. Moderation

Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has, rather than striving to have more and more.

### 3.6. Gratitude

Gratitude is a key social competence that should be developed in children.

### 3.7. Empathy and Emotional Intelligence

Children have a natural ability for empathy and understanding others' emotions. This ability should be nurtured and developed.

### 3.8. Examples in Sport

Sport as a perfect example of children's improvement.

## Part 4: Practical Tips and Reflections

### 4.1. Avoiding Pressure and Assessment

Avoid putting pressure on the child, comparing them to others, and assessing their progress. Instead, focus on supporting their internal motivation and independent learning.

### 4.2. "Situation Thinking"

Analyze situations from the perspective of: situation, group, child.

### 4.3. Quiet Communication

Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.

### 4.4. Providing Space

A child needs space to think, act, and make mistakes independently.

### 4.5. Supporting, Not Replacing

Adults should support the child, but not do things for them.

### 4.6. Acknowledging the Child's Validity

A child has their valid points, which should be acknowledged and respected.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, calls for a paradigm shift in education and upbringing. By moving away from traditional methods based on compulsion and assessment, and focusing on understanding the child's psychology, needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, collaboration, moderation, developing passions, and adapting communication and working methods to the individual characteristics of each child.`,
