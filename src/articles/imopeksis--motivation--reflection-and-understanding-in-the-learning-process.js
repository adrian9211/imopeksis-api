    content: `# Introduction

In this segment of Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues the discussion on effective teaching and upbringing, focusing on the mechanisms of motivation, the role of reflection, and the importance of understanding a child's perspective. He uses examples from everyday life and sports to illustrate how traditional methods often fail, whereas a child-centered approach yields better results.

## Part 1: Failure as a Tool for Motivation

### 1.1 Children's Reaction to Failure

Wilczewski, referring to a participant's question, analyses children's reactions to failure. He agrees that children, when faced with failure in one game, may seek another in which they succeed. However, he emphasizes that the key is the child's dependence on the pleasure of self-activity. A child should derive satisfaction from the learning process itself, overcoming difficulties, and making progress, regardless of the external outcome.

### 1.2 Real-Life Example – Cleaning

Wilczewski provides an example of his nephew, who spent two hours enthusiastically cleaning the fireplace, demonstrating remarkable creativity. This shows that children can be persistent and engaged if they have the opportunity to act independently and make decisions.

## Part 2: Communication and Relationships with Children – Avoiding Violence

### 2.1 "Words of Violence"

Wilczewski once again highlights the harm of "words of violence" in communication with children (e.g., "stop", "do", "don't say"). Such words provoke negative emotions and hinder the child's development. Instead, one should communicate with the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.

### 2.2 Avoiding Direct Confrontation and Judgement

Instead of criticizing, evaluating, or imposing one's solutions on the child, situations should be created where the child can reflect and draw conclusions. Questions that encourage thinking should be asked (e.g., "Do you think you did well or poorly?").

### 2.3 Recognising the Child's Perspective

A child has their own reasoning, which should be acknowledged and respected. Imposing one's views and expectations on a child leads to rebellion and resistance.

### 2.4 Conflict Management

In conflict situations, escalation of emotions should be avoided, and solutions that consider the perspectives of all parties should be sought. It is important to give the child space to express their feelings and needs.

## Part 3: Praise and Self-Realisation – The Pitfalls of External Motivation

### 3.1 The Harm of Excessive Praise

Wilczewski warns against excessive praise, which can make a child dependent on external approval and inhibit their internal motivation.

### 3.2 Self-Realisation and Self-Determination

The key goal of upbringing is to support the child in striving for self-realisation and self-determination. A child should have the opportunity to independently discover their talents, passions, and goals.

### 3.3 Gratitude

Parents should teach kids gratitude.

## Part 4: Sensitive Periods and Child Development Specifics

### 4.1 Sensitive Periods

Wilczewski reminds of the existence of "sensitive periods" in a child's development, which are times when a child is particularly receptive to certain stimuli and has natural predispositions to develop specific skills.

### 4.2 Characteristics of Children in Grades 4-6 (9-12 years)

- **Desire for Self-Improvement:** Children are naturally motivated to develop.
- **Strong Sense of Self-Worth:** Conflicts with authorities may lead to aggression.
- **Period of Negative Behaviour:** This is a natural phase that passes.
- **Seeking Enemies:** Children may invent "enemies".
- **Antisocial Attitude:** Children may seem antisocial but crave acceptance.
- **Tolerance:** This is a period where a lot of tolerance is required.
- **Honesty and Directness:** Children are honest and straightforward.
- **Fleeting Enthusiasm:** Children may show "fleeting enthusiasm".

### 4.3 Managing Silence

The less a teacher speaks, the more authority they have. Silence and giving space to the child for independent thinking are crucial.

## Part 5: Dreams, Passion, and Overcoming Oneself

### 5.1 The Role of Dreams

Having dreams and goals is important for a sense of purpose and direction in life.

### 5.2 Developing Passion

Teachers and parents should support the child in discovering and developing their passions.

### 5.3 Overcoming Oneself

The ability to overcome one's weaknesses is crucial for achieving success.

## Part 6: Communication and Relationships with Parents

### 6.1 Avoiding Forcing Grades

Parents should not force teachers to provide grades and information about the child's behavior. They should focus on communication with the child itself.

### 6.2 Parent-Child Cooperation

The most important thing is communication and cooperation between the parent and the child.

## Conclusion

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, calls for a paradigm shift in education. By moving away from traditional, coercion and evaluation-based methods and focusing on understanding the child's psychology, needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools for creating an environment where children can develop their full potential. The keys are reflection, independence, cooperation, and nurturing passion.`,
