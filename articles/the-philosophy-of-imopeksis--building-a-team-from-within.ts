  content: `# Introduction

In this part of the training, Tomasz Wilczewski, a representative of Imopeksis, focuses on the method of working with athletes used at Imopeksis. A key element of this philosophy is moving away from the traditional, authoritarian coaching model, which is based on issuing commands and assessing results, towards building a team "from within" – by developing the athletes' internal motivation, self-confidence, concentration, cohesion, and intuition.

## Part 1: The Imopeksis Philosophy – Listening and Understanding

### 1.1. Shadow Module and the Imopeksis Approach

Wilczewski refers to the "shadow module" (likely a concept from previous training), which focuses on the negative aspects of personality and behavior. The Imopeksis approach, however, aims to eliminate these "flaws" by developing positive traits.

### 1.2. Key Elements of the Imopeksis Method

- **Intentions:** Understanding the athletes' intentions (positive, negative, indifferent) through attentive listening, emotional resilience, and acknowledging the partner's point of view.
- **Motivation:** Focusing on internal motivation, stemming from progress and independent experience, rather than external motivation (rewards, praise).
- **Feelings:** It is important for the athlete to live and experience.
- **Confidence:** Building self-confidence by developing competencies (skills applied in practice), overcoming negative thoughts, and gaining experience in match assessments (focused on causes, not effects).
- **Emotions:** Teaching athletes to identify emotions.
- **Concentration and Cohesion:** Achieving concentration by setting small, realistic tasks and developing team cohesion through mutual understanding, tolerance, and cooperation.

## Part 2: Building Self-Confidence

### 2.1. Competencies and Skills

- A skill is mastering a particular move or action.
- Competency is the skill applied effectively in a difficult situation.
- Building self-confidence is based on developing competencies.

### 2.2. Overcoming Negative Thoughts

- Negative thoughts have a strong impact on the subconscious.
- It is crucial to consciously reject negative emotions and focus on positive aspects.

### 2.3. Match Assessments

- A match is not just about the result but primarily a test of skills.
- The athlete should evaluate the causes of their actions (e.g., how many times they performed a specific move, how many good decisions they made), not just the effects (e.g., how many points they scored).

### 2.4. Belief in the Athlete

- The coach should show belief in the athlete, even (or especially) in difficult moments.
- Avoiding "penal substitution" after an unsuccessful play is key to building self-confidence.

## Part 3: Concentration and Task-Oriented Thinking

### 3.1. Small Tasks

- Concentration is based on task-oriented thinking.
- Instead of setting general goals for athletes ("play well"), they should be assigned small, specific tasks (e.g., "make three successful passes this quarter").

### 3.2. Maintaining Uncertainty

- A slight uncertainty about task completion motivates and strengthens concentration.
- Tasks should be ambitious but realistic.

### 3.3. Constructive Self-Criticism

- Athletes should analyze their actions and draw conclusions, focusing on causes rather than just effects.

## Part 4: Team Cohesion – Building Relationships

### 4.1. Individual Significance

- Each athlete should understand their individual significance to the team, as well as the significance of other athletes.
- This builds mutual understanding and respect.

### 4.2. Getting to Know Partners

- Athletes should get to know each other during play by observing each other's strengths and weaknesses.

### 4.3. Co-Realisation and Tolerance

- Team cohesion is based on mutual tolerance, acceptance of flaws, and focusing on positive traits.
- It is important for athletes to support each other and achieve goals together.

### 4.4. Difference between Coach and Trainer

- **Coach** is a name from athletes to the trainer.
- **Trainer** is a name from the trainer to the athlete.

## Part 5: Intuition – The Effect of Cohesion

### 5.1. Intuitive Actions

- When a team is cohesive, and athletes have a high level of self-confidence and concentration, intuitive actions emerge, resulting from mutual understanding and trust.

## Summary

The philosophy of Imopeksis, represented by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a holistic approach to training that goes beyond traditional frameworks. The key to success is building the team "from within" by developing the athletes' internal motivation, self-confidence, concentration, cohesion, and intuition. The coach, instead of being a dictator, becomes a mentor and guide who supports the development of individual talents and builds strong relationships within the team. It is important to understand the difference between a coach and a trainer.`,
