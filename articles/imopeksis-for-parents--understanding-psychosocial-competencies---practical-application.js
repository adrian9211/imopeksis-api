    content: `# Introduction

In this part of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues discussing psychosocial competencies in children and adolescents by presenting a hierarchical model of development – from knowledge, through skills and competencies, to values, and then culture and transcendence. He focuses on practical guidance for parents on how to support a child's natural development while avoiding traditional upbringing mistakes.

## Part 1: Hierarchical Model of Competency Development – Continuation

### 1.1. The Four Pillars

### 2.1. Cognitive Curiosity

- A child's natural curiosity is the driving force behind their development.

- The ages of 10-12 are a period of heightened curiosity ("flash in the pan").
- Creativity research.

### 2.2. Responsibility

- "Re-sponsibility" – stepping back and allowing the child to make decisions and bear the consequences.
- Decision, risk, responsibility – three inseparable elements.

- Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has.
- Research indicates a link between moderation and happiness.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in upbringing and education. By understanding the psychology of the child, their needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, developing passions, and adapting communication and work methods to the individual characteristics of each child.`,
