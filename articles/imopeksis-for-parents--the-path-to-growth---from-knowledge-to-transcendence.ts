In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues his presentation on the hierarchical model of developing social competencies, which progresses from knowledge to values, and then to higher levels of culture and transcendence. He places particular emphasis on the ages 5-9 as a critical period for shaping these competencies, discussing the stages in detail and providing practical guidance for parents.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in upbringing and education. By understanding a child's psychology, their needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis provides tools for creating an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is autonomy, reflection, cooperation, moderation, developing passions, and tailoring communication and working methods to each child's individual characteristics. Parents play a crucial role in this process, supporting the child but not substituting for them, giving them space for independent thinking and action, and teaching them gratitude, responsibility, and respect for themselves and others.`,
