In this section of the Imopeksis training aimed at parents, Tomasz Wilczewski continues to discuss the key principles of the methodology, focusing on understanding the child's psychology, their needs, and natural predispositions. He emphasizes the importance of reflection, independence, cooperation, moderation, and developing passions. He calls for a departure from traditional educational methods based on coercion, assessment, and competition.

# Part 1: Foundations of Child Development

### 1.1. The Child as a "Reflection"

- A child reflects the influences of their environment (parents, teachers, coaches) like a mirror. Therefore, it is crucial what influences we exert on the child.

## 1.2. Methodical and Didactic Influence

- **Methodical**: What we provide the child with (e.g., play, games, exercises).
- **Didactic**: How we convey something (e.g., words, tone of voice, posture).

## 1.3. Authority

- Authority is not a position but the ability to exert influence.

## 1.4. Psychopedagogy

- The combination of knowledge in psychology and pedagogy, allowing for an understanding of the child's needs and adaptation of working methods.

## 1.5. The Child's Needs

- **Movement**: A natural need for movement, which is connected to cognitive curiosity and building self-trust.
- **Emotions**: Children need to experience all emotions.
- **Learning (Imperialism)**: An internal need for learning, acquiring skills.
- **Relationships**: Children need contact with other children.
- **Institutionalism**: The need for belonging (emerges later).
- **Outcome**: Important, but not in the sense of competition, rather as individual progress.

## 1.6. Egocentrism

- Until the age of 13, a child is focused on themselves (egocentrism) and gathers information about themselves.

## 1.7. Play vs Exercise

- **Play**: A form of activity that engages emotions, develops creativity, and allows for independent action.
- **Exercise**: A form of activity where the child performs specific tasks.
- Play generates emotions, whereas exercises do not.

## 1.8. Competition

- **True Meaning**: Competition is becoming new, developing through interaction with others.

## 2.2. Cognitive Curiosity

- A child's natural curiosity is a driving force for their development.
- Adults should support it, not suppress it.

## 2.3. Responsibility

- "Re-sponsibility" – stepping back and allowing the child to make decisions independently.
- Decision, risk, responsibility – three inseparable elements.

## 2.4. Moderation

- The ability to enjoy what one has.
- Research indicates a link between moderation and happiness.

## 2.5. Gratitude

## 3.2. "Thinking in Situations"

- Analyze situations from the perspective of: situation, group, child.

## 3.3. Quiet Communication

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.

## 3.4. Providing Space

- A child needs space for independent thinking, action, and making mistakes.

## 3.5. Supporting, Not Replacing

- Adults should support the child, but not replace them.

## 3.6. Recognizing the Child's Reasons

- **Tag and Grandma's Footsteps**: Examples of how to modify games to develop social competences (e.g., sharing, cooperation).
- **Playing football**: Analysis of errors in traditional football training approaches and proposing alternative methods focusing on cognitive and social development, not just outcomes.

# Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in upbringing and education. By understanding the child's psychology, their needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, developing passions, and adapting communication and working methods to the individual characteristics of each child. Parents play a crucial role in this process, supporting the child but not replacing them, giving them space for independent thinking and action, and teaching them gratitude, responsibility, and respect for themselves and others.`,
