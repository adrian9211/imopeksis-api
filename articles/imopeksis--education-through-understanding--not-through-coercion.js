    content: `# Introduction

In this part of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues the discussion on effective upbringing and teaching, emphasizing the understanding of child psychology, avoiding negative communication patterns, and creating an environment conducive to independent development. He uses numerous examples and anecdotes to illustrate his points and encourage reflection on one's teaching methods.

## Part 1: Failure and Motivation – Understanding the Child's Perspective

### 1.1. Failure as Part of the Process

Wilczewski, referring to a question from a training participant, discusses children's reactions to failure. He highlights that failure is a natural part of the learning process and can be motivating if the child has the opportunity to draw conclusions independently and make further attempts. The problem arises when a child has many games/activities to choose from and can easily abandon those where they do not achieve immediate success.

### 1.2. Addiction to the Pleasure of Self-Action

The goal of the Imopeksis methodology is to "addict" the child to the pleasure of self-action. A child should derive satisfaction from the learning process itself, overcoming difficulties and making progress, rather than just from external rewards or praise.

## Part 2: Communication and Relationships with the Child – Avoiding Violence

### 2.1. "Words of Violence"

Wilczewski points out the harm of "words of violence" in communication with children. These are words that express command, compulsion, criticism, judgement, or comparison (e.g., "stop", "do", "don't say"). Such words evoke negative emotions and hinder the child's development.

### 2.2. "Situational Thinking"

Instead of reacting impulsively and judging the child's behaviour, one should apply "situational thinking", which means analyzing the situation from different perspectives:

- **Situation Perspective:** What happened? What are the objective facts?
- **Group Perspective:** How does the situation affect the entire group?
- **Child's Perspective:** How does the child perceive the situation? What are their motivations and emotions?

Only after such analysis can appropriate actions be taken to support the child's development rather than hinder it.

### 2.3. Silent Communication and Providing Space

Wilczewski emphasizes that the less a teacher/parent speaks, the more authority they have. Silence, calmness, and giving the child space to think and act independently are crucial for their development. One should speak to the child softer than the child speaks to us.

### 2.4. Avoiding Direct Confrontation

Instead of directly criticizing or judging the child, situations should be created where the child can reflect and draw conclusions on their own. This can be achieved by asking questions (e.g., "Do you think you did well or poorly?") or referring the child to their own experiences.

### 2.5. Acknowledging the Child's Reasons

A child has their own reasons, which should be acknowledged and respected. Imposing one's views and expectations on the child leads to rebellion and resistance.

## Part 3: Sensitive Periods and Development Specifics in Years 4-6

### 3.1. Sensitive Periods

Wilczewski discusses "sensitive periods" in a child's development, which are times when a child is particularly receptive to certain stimuli and has natural predispositions to develop specific skills.

### 3.2. Characteristics of Children in Years 4-6 (ages 9-12)

- **Desire for Self-Improvement:** Children at this age are naturally motivated to develop and improve their skills.
- **Strong Sense of Self-Worth:** Any conflicts with authorities may lead to aggression.
- **Period of Negative Behaviours:** This is a natural stage that passes. It is important not to suppress these behaviours but to understand them.
- **Seeking Enemies:** Children may invent "enemies" for themselves.
- **Asocial Attitude:** Children may appear asocial, but simultaneously desire belonging to a group.
- **Tolerance:** This is a period when one must show great tolerance towards the child's behaviours and emotions.
- **Honesty and Straightforwardness:** Children are honest and direct.
- **Fleeting Enthusiasm:** Children may show "fleeting enthusiasm", meaning a desire to engage in various activities.

### 3.3. Avoiding Direct Confrontation

When a problem occurs, try to avoid it and give time to cool down.

## Part 4: Passion, Dreams and Self-Improvement

### 4.1. The Importance of Dreams

It is crucial to have dreams.

### 4.2. The Role of Passion

It is important to awaken passion in kids.

### 4.3. Overcoming Oneself

The ability to overcome one's weaknesses is key to achieving success in life.

## Part 5: Summary and Practical Tips

### 5.1. Learning from Children

Adults should learn from children – their natural curiosity, creativity, openness, and capacity for reflection.

### 5.2. Communication with Parents

Parents should not force teachers to provide grades and information about the child's behaviour. Instead, they should focus on communicating with the child themselves. The best way of communication is intrapersonal.

### 5.3. Reflection

Reflection is a key element of the learning process. A child must have the time and space to think over and analyze their experiences.

### 5.4. Independence and Responsibility

Children should be given as much independence and responsibility as possible. Allow them to make decisions, make mistakes, and learn from their own experiences.

## Summary

The training conducted by Tomasz Wilczewski is a call for a paradigm shift in education. The Imopeksis methodology, based on understanding child psychology, neurodidactics, and practical exercises, aims to create an environment where children can develop their full potential, becoming independent, creative, and happy individuals. The key is to move away from compulsion, evaluation, and competition, and focus on support, reflection, cooperation, and developing passion.`,
