In this part of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues discussing the DISC model, focusing on practical examples of its application in sports, specifically basketball. He analyzes how different combinations of DISC types (Dominance, Initiative, Steadiness, Compliance) affect team dynamics, playing style, and interactions between players. He emphasizes the importance of individualizing the coaching approach and adapting strategies to the specific personality traits of each player.

## Part 1: DISC Model – Examples from Basketball

### 1.1. Hypothetical Team Compositions

Wilczewski presents hypothetical team compositions made up solely of players with one dominant DISC type to illustrate how it influences playing style:

- **4 x D (Dominant):** Initial successes based on individual skills and aggression, but later conflicts, lack of cooperation, blame-shifting, and playing 1 against 4.
- **4 x I (Inspiring):** Lots of fun, enthusiasm, mutual support, but lack of focus on goals, difficulties in decision-making, and an excessive focus on relationships.
- **4 x S (Supportive):** Stability, good defense, conscientiousness, but lack of initiative, difficulty taking risks, uncertainty in decisive moments.
- **4 x C (Analytical):** Thorough analysis, but excessive focus on details, difficulty in making quick decisions, "overthinking."

### 1.2. Importance of Diversity

Wilczewski emphasizes that an ideal team should consist of players with different DISC profiles to harness the strengths of each type and balance out weaknesses.

## Part 2: Individualizing the Coaching Approach

### 2.1. Understanding Individual Traits

A coach should understand each player's DISC model to:

- **Adapt Communication:** Communicate differently with a D type person than with an S type person, etc.
- **Adjust Tasks:** Different tasks will be suitable for an I type person than for a C type person.
- **Motivate:** Each type is motivated differently.
- **Manage the Team:** Assign players to tasks according to their predispositions, manage conflicts, build relationships.

### 2.2. Practical Examples

Wilczewski provides numerous examples from his coaching practice, illustrating how he:

- Used knowledge of DISC models to make personnel and tactical decisions.
- Adapted his communication style to individual players.
- Handled difficult situations resulting from differences in players' personalities.
- Different profiles have different approaches, not only to sports.

### 2.3. "Tough Mind" (CD)

A person combining dominance and analytical traits – difficult to work with, but capable of analyzing and making decisions.

### 2.4. Scorer (Extreme D)

Relentless, focused on scoring, individualistic.

### 2.5. Playmaker (CS)

Conscientious, precise, well-trained, but may lack spontaneity and initiative.

### 2.6. Showman (Extreme I)

Extroverted, sociable, likes to be the center of attention, can change the game's dynamics.

### 2.7. Heart (SI)

Empathetic, supportive, good leader, capable of inspiring others.

### 2.8. Scrapper (Extreme S)

A person for the "dirty work," ready to make sacrifices, solid, but may lack self-confidence.

### 2.9. Lone Wolf (Extreme C)

An expert in their field, analytical, but may struggle with communication and cooperation.

### 2.10. Stern Father (DS)

Combines demands and discipline with support.

### 2.11. Mediator (IC)

Combines communication skills and empathy with an analytical approach.

## Part 3: Practical Exercise – Team Building

### 3.1. Task for Participants

Wilczewski asks training participants to perform an exercise:

- **Create a "Dream Five":** Select five players (representing different DISC profiles) for an ideal basketball team lineup.
- **Simulate a Match:** Simulate various match scenarios (e.g., maintaining a lead, recovering from a deficit) and make decisions on lineup changes, considering the players' DISC profiles.

### 3.2. Objective of the Exercise

The objective of the exercise is to make participants aware of how different personality types affect team dynamics and how this knowledge can be used to make strategic decisions.

## Summary

This part of the Imopeksis training focuses on the practical application of the DISC model in sports, specifically in basketball. Through numerous examples and exercises, Tomasz Wilczewski demonstrates how understanding different personality types can help coaches build stronger teams, communicate more effectively, and individualize their approach to each player. He highlights that the key to success is not only knowledge of DISC models but also the ability to flexibly adapt strategies and tactics to the specific situation and the team's nature.`,
