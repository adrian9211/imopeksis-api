  content: `# Introduction

In this segment of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski engages in an interactive discussion with participants, analyzing their experiences, answering questions, and delving deeper into the key principles of methodology. There is a particular focus on understanding individual differences among children, adapting teaching methods to their needs, and creating an environment conducive to independent learning and development.

## Part 1: Analysis of Previous Exercises and Discussion

### 1.1. Participants' Reflections

Wilczewski asks participants for their reflections and impressions from previous exercises, leading to a discussion on:

- **The Role of Failure:** Participant Kasia notes that failure can demotivate children, especially when they have many choices (e.g., games). Wilczewski agrees that failure is an inherent part of learning but emphasizes the importance of creating an environment where a child can learn from mistakes and derive satisfaction from independent action.
- **Working with a Child:** A child who has experienced trauma may require more time and support.

### 1.2. Intentions and Communication

Intentions are directed towards:

- The teacher.
- The teacher's programme.
- The group.

The child will always strive to fulfill or lack fulfillment.

## Part 2: DISC Model – Practical Application in a Team

### 2.1. Combinations of DISC Types in a Team

Wilczewski analyzes how different combinations of DISC types (D, I, S, C) affect team dynamics, providing examples from basketball:

- **4 x D:** Initial successes based on individual skills but later conflicts, lack of cooperation, and blame-shifting.
- **4 x I:** Lots of fun and enthusiasm, but lack of focus on the goal, difficulties in decision-making.
- **4 x S:** Stability, good defense, conscientiousness, but lack of initiative and risk-taking.
- **4 x C:** Precise analysis but difficulties in making quick decisions and acting, excessive focus on details.

### 2.2. Individualizing the Approach

Understanding the DISC model allows for:

- **Adapting Communication:** Communicating differently with each type.
- **Adapting Tasks:** Different tasks will suit each type.
- **Motivating:** Each type is motivated differently.
- **Team Building:** Assigning tasks to individuals according to their predispositions.

### 2.3. Real-Life Examples

Wilczewski provides real-life examples to illustrate how DISC models manifest in various situations.

## Part 3: Communication and Dealing with Problems

### 3.1. Example of Communication with D

When addressing D, we must be mindful of their need for dominance and tendency to perceive messages as attacks. It's important to be specific and direct, while avoiding confrontation and allowing room for independent decision-making.

### 3.2. Example with a Difficult Student

Wilczewski recounts a story about a student with a high level of aggression.

### 3.3. Approach to a Difficult Child

Wilczewski suggests leveraging a child's natural predispositions (e.g., initiative) and assigning them responsible tasks. It's crucial to create an environment where the child feels safe and accepted.

### 3.4. Importance of Reflection

Wilczewski emphasizes that it is essential for a child to have time to reflect on their actions and emotions. Adults should not interrupt this process with immediate evaluation, criticism, or providing ready-made solutions.

## Part 4: Summary and Practical Advice

### 4.1. Avoiding "Words of Violence"

- Avoid words expressing command, coercion, criticism, evaluation, or comparison.

### 4.2. "Thinking with the Situation"

- Analyze situations from the perspective of: the situation, the group, the child.

### 4.3. Quiet Communication

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.

### 4.4. Allowing Space

- A child needs space to think, act independently, and make mistakes.

### 4.5. Supporting, Not Replacing

- Adults should support the child but not do things on their behalf.

### 4.6. Acknowledging the Child's Reasons

- A child has their own reasons, which should be acknowledged and respected.

### 4.7. Sensitive Periods

Wilczewski discusses sensitive periods:

- Desire for self-improvement.
- Strong sense of worth.
- Period of negative behavior.
- Seeking enemies.
- Antisocial attitude.
- Tolerance.
- Honesty, straightforwardness.
- Fleeting enthusiasm.

### 4.8. Managing Silence

- The less a teacher speaks, the greater their authority.

### 4.9. Passion and Dreams

- It is important to support a child in developing their passions and pursuing their dreams.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, conducted by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call for a paradigm shift in education and upbringing. By moving away from traditional, coercion and evaluation-based methods, and focusing on understanding the child's psychology, needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key lies in independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, and the development of passion, as well as adapting communication and working methods to the child's individual behavioral model (DISC).`,
