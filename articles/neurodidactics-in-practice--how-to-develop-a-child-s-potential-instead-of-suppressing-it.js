In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues his critique of the traditional education system, emphasizing the fundamental difference between the perspective of adults and the neurobiological development of children. He argues that teachers, especially in early childhood education, should be significantly better remunerated, but only if their teaching methods support, rather than hinder, the natural development of the child.

## Part 1: Mismatch Between Adults and Children's Needs

### 1.1. Neurobiological Differences

Referencing Professor Kaczmarzyk, Wilczewski highlights that an adult's brain cannot fully comprehend or even recall how a child's brain functions. Only in older people (grandparents) do neuronal connections develop in the front part of the brain, allowing for a better "sense" of the child.

### 1.2. Development Priorities

Wilczewski argues that the priority in education should be developing social competencies and the cognitive system (nervous system efficiency), followed by physical activity. He emphasizes the importance of neurodidactics, i.e., teaching methods based on the knowledge of brain functioning.

### 1.3. Model of a Sportsman

The model of sportsmen should include:

- Moral
- Ethical
- Intellectual abilities
- Basic programme
- Physical abilities

## Part 2: Reflection and Example – The Key to Learning

### 2.1. The Child as a "Reflection"

A child learns not only through exercises but, most importantly, through reflection on their own experiences. They mirror the influences of their environment (parents, teachers, peers) like a mirror.

### 2.2. Lack of Physiological Reflection

Modern parents often do not allow children to experience basic physiological reflection (e.g., feeling hunger), which has negative consequences for their development.

### 2.3. Brain Development

- A one-month-old child - low level of connections.
- A five-year-old - genius.
- A fourteen-year-old - end of neuroplastic development of the brain. Half of the emotions are not connected with actions.

## Part 3: Stages of Child Development and Teaching Methods

### 3.1. Developmental Stages

Wilczewski discusses the key stages of child development:

- **5-9 years**: A period of intense social competence development.
- **9-12 years**: "Kingdom" – a time of intense cognitive development. Children should learn through experience.
- **14 years**: A period where physical development is prioritized.

### 3.2. "Straw Enthusiasm" (9-11 years)

At the age of 9-11, a child is characterized by "straw enthusiasm," a desire to try many different activities. Adults often make the mistake of limiting this natural curiosity by forcing the child to focus on one sport discipline.

### 3.3. Methodical Influence vs Didactic Influence

- **Methodical Influence**: What we give to the child (e.g., play). The child responds to this influence with emotions, movement, and engagement.
- **Didactic Influence**: How we convey something (e.g., praise, criticism, explanation). It is often ineffective or even harmful.

## Part 4: Play vs Exercise – Key Differences

### 4.1. What is Play?

Play is not just a form of activity but, above all, a state of mind. It is characterized by:

- **Internal Motivation**: The child is engaged and motivated.
- **Creativity**: The child has the opportunity to experiment and invent new solutions.
- **Responsibility**: The child makes decisions and bears the consequences.
- **Emotions**: Play evokes a range of emotions (joy, excitement, but also frustration and anger), which are a natural part of the learning process.

### 4.2. What is Exercise?

Exercise is a form of activity where the child performs specific tasks, often imposed by an adult. It can be boring, monotonous, and does not provide space for independent thinking.

### 4.3. How to Transform Exercise into Play?

To transform exercise into play, one should:

- Give the child a choice and the ability to make decisions.
- Encourage creativity and experimentation.
- Introduce an element of competition, but not based on results, rather on self-improvement.
- Focus on the process, not just the outcome.

## Part 5: Authority and Influence

### 5.1. What is Authority?

Authority is not a position or a title but the ability to influence others. The greater the influence, the greater the authority.

### 5.2. Negative Effects of External Motivation

Praise, rewards, and other forms of external motivation can be harmful because:

- They kill internal motivation.
- They make the child dependent on external evaluation.
- They hinder the development of independence and creativity.
- They lead to mental laziness.

### 5.3. Self-Praise and Gratitude

Instead of external praise, children should be taught self-praise and gratitude. A child should be able to appreciate their own achievements and be grateful for what they have.

## Part 6: Communication and Internal Dialogue

Four types of communication:

- Internal dialogues.
- Interpersonal communication.
- Indirect communication.
- Media communication.

The most important is internal dialogue.

## Part 7: Summary and Practical Advice

### 7.1. Learning from Children

Adults should learn from children – their natural curiosity, creativity, and joy in learning.

### 7.2. Reflection – The Key to Learning

The most important element of the learning process is reflection – thinking through and analyzing one's experiences. A lesson does not last 45 minutes but 24 hours – most happens at home when the child processes information and integrates it with their knowledge.

### 7.3. Resources

Kids need to gain resources:

- Knowledge.
- Abilities.
- Praise for doing things well.
- Value.

### 7.4. Call to Action

## Summary

The Imopeksis methodology, presented by Tomasz Wilczewski, is based on a deep understanding of the neurobiological development of children and their natural needs. By moving away from traditional, control and assessment-based methods and focusing on creating conditions for independent learning, collaboration, creativity, and reflection, Imopeksis offers teachers and parents tools to support the full potential of the child.`,
