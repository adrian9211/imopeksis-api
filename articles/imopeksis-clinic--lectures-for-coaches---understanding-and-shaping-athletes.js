In this segment of the Imopeksis Clinic training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues his lecture for coaches, focusing on a deeper understanding of athlete psychology, training methodology, and the importance of reflection and independence in the training process. He emphasizes that the key to success is not only technical and tactical knowledge but above all, the ability to build relationships with athletes, tailor work methods to their individual needs, and create an environment conducive to their comprehensive development.

## Part 1: Reflection and Self-improvement of the Coach

### 1.1 Importance of Reflection

- Wilczewski highlights that true learning and development, both for athletes and coaches, occur through reflection on one's own actions, mistakes, and successes.

### 1.2 Self-improvement

- A coach should continually strive for self-improvement, seek new knowledge, confront different approaches, and adapt their work methods.

### 1.3 Avoiding Patterns

- One should avoid patterns and routine; instead, seek innovative solutions and tailor training to the individual needs of the athletes.

## Part 2: Psychopedagogy and the Coach's Influence

### 2.1 Psychopedagogy

- The combination of psychological and pedagogical knowledge allows for understanding athletes' needs and adapting training methods.

### 2.2 Coach's Influence

- A coach has a significant influence on the development of athletes, not only in terms of their sporting skills but also regarding their personality, attitudes, and values.

### 2.3 Communication

- **Avoiding "Words of Violence"**: Avoid words that express command, coercion, criticism, judgement, or comparison.
- **Quiet Communication**: Speak to athletes calmly and respectfully.
- **Giving Space**: Athletes need space for independent thinking, acting, and making mistakes.
- **Listening and Understanding**: Listen carefully to athletes and strive to understand their perspective.
- **Referring Back to the Athlete**: Instead of providing ready answers, ask questions that encourage reflection.

### 2.4 Errors of Traditional Approaches

- Wilczewski criticizes traditional training methods that:
  - Focus solely on results.
  - Rely on coercion and control.
  - Do not consider individual needs and predispositions of the athletes.
  - Inhibit creativity and independence.

## Part 3: DISC Model and Individualising Approach

### 3.1 DISC Model

- Wilczewski briefly discusses the DISC model (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness), emphasizing that understanding this model allows for:
  - **Adapting Communication**: Communicating differently with each type.
  - **Adapting Tasks**: Different tasks will be suitable for each type.
  - **Motivating**: Each type has different motivations.
  - **Team Building**: Assigning athletes to tasks according to their predispositions.

### 3.2 Examples from Basketball

- Wilczewski provides examples from basketball, illustrating how different DISC types behave on the court and how this can be utilized in training.

## Part 4: Practical Tips for Coaches

### 4.1 Observation

- A coach should carefully observe athletes during training to adjust exercises and provide appropriate guidance.

### 4.2 Adaptation

- A coach should be flexible and modify exercises depending on how athletes handle them.

### 4.3 Mutual Learning

- A coach should encourage athletes to learn from and support each other.

### 4.4 Creating a Positive Atmosphere

- A coach should ensure a positive atmosphere in training, conducive to learning and development.

### 4.5 Importance of Reflection

- A coach should encourage athletes to reflect on their actions and draw conclusions.

### 4.6 Self-improvement

- A coach should strive for self-improvement.

## Summary

This segment of the Imopeksis training calls for a paradigm shift in sports coaching. By understanding the psychology of the athlete, their needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where athletes can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, collaboration, moderation, nurturing passion, and tailoring communication and work methods to the individual characteristics of each athlete. The coach plays a crucial role in this process, supporting the athlete without doing things for them, giving them space for independent thought and action, and teaching them responsibility and respect for themselves and others.`,
