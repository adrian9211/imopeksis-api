In this section of the training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues his discussion on the DISC model (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness), focusing on practical examples of its application in working with children, both in sports and education. He emphasizes how understanding different personality types can aid in building effective communication, motivation, conflict resolution, and creating an optimal environment for learning and development.

## Part 1: The DISC Model – Characteristics and Interactions

### 1.1. Recap of DISC Types

Wilczewski recalls the characteristics of the four basic DISC types:

- **D (Dominant):** Confident, decisive, goal-oriented, controlling.
- **I (Influencing):** Sociable, open, enthusiastic, creative.
- **S (Steady):** Calm, stable, diligent, loyal, empathetic.
- **C (Conscientious):** Accurate, precise, analytical, logical.

### 1.2. Combinations of DISC Types

Most people have a profile consisting of two dominant types, usually adjacent on the DISC chart.

### 1.3. Examples of Mixed Profiles

- **Tough Mind (CD):** Combines dominance and analytical traits – a person challenging to work with, convinced of their own correctness.
- **Scorer (Extreme D):** Ruthless, goal-oriented, individualist.
- **Playmaker (CS):** Diligent, precise, but may lack initiative.
- **Showman (Extreme I):** Extroverted, enjoys being the centre of attention.
- **Heart (SI):** Empathetic, supportive, good leader.
- **Grafter (Extreme S):** Person for "grunt work," willing to make sacrifices.
- **Lone Wolf (Extreme C):** Expert, analytical, but may struggle with communication.
- **Stern Father (DS):** Combines demands with support.
- **Mediator (IC):** Combines communicativeness and empathy with an analytical approach.

## Part 2: Application of DISC Models in Practice – Sport and Education

### 2.1. Team Dynamics

Different combinations of DISC types affect team dynamics:

- **4 x D:** Initial successes, but later conflicts and lack of cooperation.
- **4 x I:** Lots of fun, but lack of focus on goals.
- **4 x S:** Stability, good defence, but lack of initiative.
- **4 x C:** Thorough analysis, but difficulties in making quick decisions.

### 2.2. Individualising Approaches

Understanding the DISC model allows for:

- **Adapting Communication:** Communicating differently with each type.
- **Adapting Tasks:** Different tasks are appropriate for each type.
- **Motivating:** Each type is motivated differently.
- **Building Teams:** Assigning people to tasks according to their predispositions.
- **Managing Conflicts:** Understanding the causes of conflicts.

### 2.3. Communication with Individual Types

- **D:** Be direct, straightforward, without beating around the bush. Acknowledge their point, but present alternatives.
- **I:** Create a friendly atmosphere, allow for emotional expression, avoid criticism.
- **S:** Provide a sense of security, stability, avoid sudden changes, give clear instructions.
- **C:** Provide data, facts, analyses, be precise, avoid generalities.

### 2.4. Life Examples

Wilczewski provides numerous examples from life, sports, and politics to illustrate how DISC models manifest in different situations (e.g., behaviour at a disco, buying a television, marital relations, stress reactions).

### 2.5. Importance of Self-Awareness

Both adults and children should strive for self-awareness – understanding their own behaviour model and its impact on relationships with others.

## Part 3: Practical Tips and Reflections

### 3.1. Avoiding "Violent Words"

Avoid words expressing commands, compulsion, criticism, judgement, or comparison.

### 3.2. "Thinking Situationally"

Analyse situations from the perspective of: the situation, the group, the child.

### 3.3. Quiet Communication

Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and with respect.

### 3.4. Providing Space

A child needs space for independent thinking, actions, and making mistakes.

### 3.5. Supporting, Not Replacing

Adults should support the child, but not do things for them.

### 3.6. Acknowledging the Child's Perspective

A child has their own viewpoints, which should be acknowledged and respected.

### 3.7. Importance of Emotions

Emotions aid in memory retention.

### 3.8. Intentions

Intentions are directed towards:

- The teacher.
- The programme.
- The group.

### 3.9. Reflection and Self-Improvement

Reflection and self-awareness are key.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in education and upbringing. By moving away from traditional methods based on compulsion and assessment, and focusing on understanding the child's psychology, needs, and natural predispositions (including DISC behaviour models), Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, and nurturing passion, as well as adapting communication and work methods to the individual characteristics of each child.`,
