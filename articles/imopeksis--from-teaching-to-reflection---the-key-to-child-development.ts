  content: `# Introduction

In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues to discuss the key principles of the methodology, emphasizing reflection as a fundamental element of the learning process. He explains why traditional teaching methods based on compulsion, assessment, and immediate results are ineffective and even harmful to a child's development. He presents the structure of a lesson based on three phases: teaching, refining, and training, and highlights the role of the teacher as a facilitator, not a dictator.

## Part 1: Reflection – The Key to Lasting Learning

### 1.1. Learning Beyond the Lesson

Wilczewski stresses that true learning does not occur during a 45-minute lesson but afterwards, in the process of reflection. A child needs time to process information, integrate it with their knowledge and experience, and then draw conclusions.

### 1.2. Duration of Reflection

The reflection process can take from one day to up to three weeks. A child may revisit the experiences from the lesson, think them over, discuss them with others, and only after some time fully understand and assimilate the new knowledge or skill.

### 1.3. Avoiding Immediate Assessment

Teachers and parents often make the mistake of expecting immediate results and assessing a child right after task completion. This interrupts the reflection process and hampers development.

## Part 2: Three Phases of a Lesson – Structure and Purpose

### 2.1. Teaching

- **Objective:** Introducing new skills in a logical and orderly manner.
- **Method:** Stations (circuits) with simple exercises, "guardians" (student leaders).
- **Teacher's Role:** Supportive – helping with understanding, providing guidance, but not imposing solutions.
- **Brain:** Activation of the left (logic, sequences) and right (imagination, imitation) hemispheres.

### 2.2. Refining

- **Objective:** Developing skills in more complex situations, with elements of interaction, play, and challenges.
- **Method:** Movement games, combining movements, working in pairs/groups, responding to signals.
- **Teacher's Role:** Creative – introducing tasks, modifying rules, observing and adapting.
- **Brain:** Activation of the front (decisions, perception) and back (intuition, spontaneity) parts of the brain.

### 2.3. Training

- **Objective:** Consolidating skills through intensive training, engaging both the body and mind.
- **Method:** High-intensity and complexity exercises, limited time, psychological pressure (but internal, not imposed by the teacher).
- **Teacher's Role:** Enforcing (but not through criticism, rather by setting challenges and monitoring progress), observing, adjusting the load.
- **Brain:** Activation of the upper (deep self-understanding) and lower (deep understanding of others) parts of the brain.

### 2.4. Practical Examples

Wilczewski provides numerous practical examples, illustrating how these three phases can be applied in various contexts (e.g., dance learning, maths lessons, sports training).

## Part 3: Social Competence and Child Development

### 3.1. The Child as a "Reflection"

A child mirrors the influences of their environment like a mirror. Therefore, it is crucial what influences we exert on the child.

### 3.2. "Words of Violence"

Avoid words that express command, compulsion, criticism, judgment, or comparison.

### 3.3. Independence and Responsibility

Children should be given as much independence and responsibility as possible. Allow them to make decisions, make mistakes, and learn from their own experiences.

### 3.4. Cognitive Curiosity

A child's natural curiosity is the driving force of their development. Adults should support this curiosity, not suppress it.

### 3.5. Moderation

Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has.

### 3.6. Gratitude

Wilczewski emphasizes the importance of gratitude.

### 3.7. Empathy and Emotional Intelligence

Children have a natural ability for empathy and understanding others' emotions. This ability should be nurtured.

### 3.8. The Power of Peer-Learning

Kids learn from each other.

## Part 4: The Role of the Teacher – Facilitator, Not Dictator

### 4.1. Understanding the Child

A teacher should strive to understand the individual needs, predispositions, and thinking patterns of each child.

### 4.2. Creating an Environment

A teacher should create an environment conducive to independent learning, collaboration, creativity, and reflection.

### 4.3. Supporting, Not Replacing

A teacher should support the child, but not replace them. They should ask questions, guide, provide hints, but not impose ready-made solutions.

### 4.4. Flexibility and Adaptation

A teacher should be flexible and adapt their methods to the changing needs and capabilities of children.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in education and upbringing. By moving away from traditional methods based on compulsion and assessment, and focusing on understanding the psychology of the child, their needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, developing passions, and tailoring communication and working methods to the individual characteristics of each child.`,
