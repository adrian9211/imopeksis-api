    content: `# Introduction

In this segment of the Imopeksis training programme aimed at parents, Tomasz Wilczewski continues discussing the hierarchical model of psychosocial competence development, emphasizing the importance of independence, reflection, and understanding a child's perspective. He provides practical tips and examples on how to support a child's development while avoiding traditional, coercion-based, and evaluative educational methods.

## Part 1: Hierarchy of Competence Development – A Recap

### 1.1. The Four Pillars

- **Knowledge**: The basic information that a child acquires from informed adults.
- **Skill**: The ability to apply knowledge practically.
- **Competence**: A lasting habit, agency in action, the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new situations.
- **Value**: A deep conviction of the correctness of a given competence, a level of selflessness.

### 1.2. Higher Levels

- **Individual Culture**: A person becomes a role model.
- **Team Culture**: A group of people guided by shared values.
- **Social Culture**: The influence of individuals and groups on society.
- **Transcendence**: The level of spiritual connection.

## Part 2: Key Social Competencies – Examples and Applications

### 2.1. Cognitive Curiosity

- A child's natural curiosity is the driving force of their development.
- Adults should support this curiosity rather than suppress it.

### 2.2. Responsibility

- "Re-sponsibility" – stepping back and allowing the child to make their own decisions and face the consequences.
- Decision, risk, responsibility – three inseparable elements.
- Avoid advising and doing things for the child.
- Support rather than substitute – discreetly supporting the child.

### 2.3. Moderation

- Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has.

### 2.4. Gratitude

### 2.5. Communication

- **Intrapersonal**
- **Interpersonal**
- **Indirect**
- **Media**

### 2.6. Teamwork

- It is a remedy for negative behaviours.
- Age diversity is important.
- It has its stages: from "me for others" through small and large groups, to a team.

### 2.7. Generosity

- Generosity is more than giving gifts.
- It comes from the heart.

### 2.8. Friendship

- Consists of empathy, tolerance, respect, and selfless help.

### 2.9. Love

- The highest level of development.

### 2.10. Sensitive Periods

- Wilczewski reminds us of sensitive periods.

## Part 3: Practical Tips for Parents and Teachers

### 3.1. Avoiding "Words of Violence"

- Avoid words expressing command, coercion, criticism, evaluation, or comparison.

### 3.2. "Situational Thinking"

- Analyse situations from the perspective of the situation, the group, the child.

### 3.3. Quiet Communication

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.

### 3.4. Providing Space

- A child needs space for independent thinking, action, and making mistakes.

### 3.5. Supporting, Not Substituting

- Adults should support the child but not substitute for them.

### 3.6. Recognising the Child's Perspective

- A child has their own perspectives, which should be recognised and respected.

### 3.7. Reflection

- Reflection is key to the learning process.

### 3.8. Self-Realisation

- The significant role of self-realisation in a child's development.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training is a call to change the paradigm in upbringing and education. By understanding the psychology of the child, their needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key lies in independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, nurturing passions, and adapting communication and methods to the individual characteristics of each child.`,
