## Part 1: Key Principles of Imopeksis â€“ Recap and Deepening

### 1.1. The Child as a "Reflection"

- A child mirrors the influences of their environment like a mirror, making it crucial what influences we exert on them.

### 1.2. Methodical and Didactic Influence

- **Methodical**: What we provide to the child (e.g., play, games).
- **Didactic**: How we convey something (words, tone of voice, attitude).

- Authority is not a position but the ability to exert influence.

### 1.4. Psychopedagogy

- The integration of knowledge from psychology and pedagogy.
