In this segment of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski, in conversation with [likely the host], summarizes the key principles of the methodology and their application in child-rearing. The discussion focuses on understanding a child's natural needs and predispositions, fostering independence, reflection, cooperation, and the development of passion. Wilczewski emphasizes that the aim is not to achieve external successes but to build the child's inner strength and values.

## Part 1: Basic Principles of Imopeksis – A Reminder

### 1.1. Movement, Emotions, Learning, Relationships

Wilczewski reminds us that for children, the most important are:

- **Movement**: The natural need for movement, which is linked to cognitive curiosity.
- **Emotions**: Children need to experience the full range of emotions, not just the positive ones.
- **Learning (Imperialism)**: The internal need for learning, acquiring skills, and self-discovery.
- **Relationships**: Children need contact with other children and adults.

### 1.2. Reflection

A key element of the learning process is reflection – thinking through and analyzing one's own experiences.

### 1.3. Independence

A child should have the opportunity to make decisions independently, make mistakes, and learn from their own experiences.

### 1.4. Cooperation

Cooperation with other children and adults is important for social and emotional development.

### 1.5. Moderation

Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has, rather than striving to have more and more.

Gratitude is a key social competence that should be developed in children.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, conducted by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call for a paradigm shift in upbringing and education. By understanding the child's psychology, needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, developing passion, and adapting communication and methods to the individual characteristics of each child. Parents play a crucial role in this process, supporting the child but not doing things for them, giving them space for independent thinking and action, and teaching them gratitude, responsibility, and respect for themselves and others.`,
