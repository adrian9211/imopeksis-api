In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski, together with Marta, demonstrates how to apply the principles of methodology in a practical dance lesson. The lesson focuses on five "qualities of movement" and is divided into three phases: teaching, refining, and training. The aim is to show how to engage students, develop their skills, build confidence, and promote independent learning, all in an atmosphere of fun and collaboration.

## Part 1: Teaching – Discovering "Qualities of Movement" (Left and Right Hemisphere)

### 1.1. Stations with "Guardians"

The lesson begins with a division into five stations, each focusing on a different "quality of movement":

- **Swing**: Pendulum movement involving different body parts (arms, legs, hips, head).
- **Push-ups**: Dynamic movements resembling pulsing, heartbeat.
- **Shaking**: Vibrations of different body parts.
- **Wave**: Smooth, undulating movement passing through the whole body.
- **Shapes/Poses**: Adopting static positions and holding them for 2 seconds.

At each station, there is a "guardian" – a student who demonstrates the movement and helps others master it. This introduces an element of student-led learning and builds responsibility.

### 1.2. Rotation and Modification

Students rotate between stations, allowing them to discover all "qualities of movement". "Guardians" and the teacher introduce exercise modifications, such as:

- Isolating movement (e.g., "just the arm", "just the leg").
- Adding technical elements (e.g., "high chin", "long neck").
- Changing the dynamics and space of movement.

### 1.3. Role of the Teacher

The teacher acts as an observer and facilitator. They do not impose ready-made solutions but:

- Support "guardians".
- Ask questions that guide students to the correct execution of the movement.
- Adjust the difficulty level of exercises.
- Ensure a safe and supportive environment.

### 1.4. Changing "Guardians"

Regularly changing "guardians" gives each student a chance to take on a leadership role and develop communication skills.

## Part 2: Refining – Developing Skills in a Dynamic Environment (Front and Back Brain)

### 2.1. Movement Games

Students move on to movement games that integrate the "qualities of movement" they have learned:

- **Responding to Signals**: At a clap, students perform specific movements (e.g., pairing up and doing the same movement, forming threes and performing different movements). This develops perception, decision-making, and intuition.
- **Tag with Elements of "Qualities of Movement"**: A person caught by the tagger performs a specific movement, and release occurs by imitating that movement.

### 2.2. Adaptation and Modification

The teacher modifies the games, adjusting the difficulty level to the students' abilities, for example:

- Changing the pace.
- Adding constraints (e.g., "it only counts if the chin is high").
- Changing the rules.

### 2.3. Combining Movements

Students practice combining different "qualities of movement" (e.g., "shaking hands and wave with legs").

## Part 3: Training – Intensification and Consolidation (Top and Bottom Brain)

### 3.1. "North, South, East, West"

Introducing spatial orientation, using the cardinal directions as reference points for different "qualities of movement". Students run to designated spots on a signal, performing their assigned movements. This exercise develops:

- Spatial Orientation.
- Movement Memory.
- Reaction Speed.

### 3.2. Cooperation in Pairs and Groups

Exercises are modified for work in pairs and groups, requiring coordination, communication, and collaboration.

### 3.3. Choreography Creation

Students, divided into teams, create short choreographic sequences using the "qualities of movement" they have learned. Team leaders guide the group.

### 3.4. Increasing Intensity

Increase intensity to engage the brain.

## Part 4: Summary and Reflection

### 4.1. Repetition of "Qualities of Movement"

Students recall the names and key elements of each "quality of movement", reinforcing the knowledge gained.

### 4.2. Importance of Reflection

Wilczewski emphasizes that the most important element of the lesson is reflection – the contemplation and analysis of their own experiences by the students.

## Summary

The presented dance lesson, based on the Imopeksis methodology, demonstrates how classes can be conducted in an engaging, effective, and child-development supportive manner. By gradually transitioning from simple exercises to more complex forms of movement, utilizing fun, student-led learning, and continuous adaptation and observation, the teacher creates an environment where students can develop their skills, build confidence, learn cooperation, and derive joy from learning.`,
