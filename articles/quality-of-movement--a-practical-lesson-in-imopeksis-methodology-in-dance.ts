  content: `# Introduction

In this part of the training, Tomasz Wilczewski from Imopeksis, along with Marta, demonstrates the practical application of his teaching methodology, inspired by dance. The lesson, based on the concept of "movement qualities," aims to show how to engage students, develop their skills, and build confidence while avoiding traditional methods based on assessment and criticism.

## Part 1: Lesson Structure – Three Phases of Development

### 1.1. Teaching (Acquainting)

**Objective:** Introducing students to basic "movement qualities."

**Method:** Division into stations, where students, under the guidance of "guardians" (chosen from among themselves), learn and practice individual qualities:

- **Wave:** Fluid movement resembling the undulation of water, involving the entire body.
- **Swing:** Pendulum-like movement, reminiscent of swinging.
- **Shapes:** "Freezes" – adopting specific positions and holding them for a moment.
- **Shaking:** Vibrations of different body parts.
- **Pumping:** Dynamic movements with distinct pauses.

**Role of the Teacher:** Observation, support for "guardians," asking questions, but not imposing solutions. The teacher adopts the role of a novice.

**Role of the Students:** Active participation, learning from each other, decision-making (choosing "guardians").

**Left and right hemispheres:** The exercise engages both brain hemispheres.

### 1.2. Perfecting (Skill Development)

**Objective:** Developing the learned movement qualities in more complex situations.

**Method:** Movement games where students use the learned qualities dynamically (e.g., running around the room and performing specific movements on cue, combining different qualities).

**Role of the Teacher:** Introducing global tasks (e.g., "a caught person must perform a specific movement"), modifying game rules, observing and adjusting difficulty levels.

**Role of the Students:** Creativity, adaptation, collaboration.

### 1.3. Training (Reinforcing)

**Objective:** Reinforcing skills through intensive training, engaging both body and mind.

**Method:** High-intensity and complex exercises (e.g., "day and night" – running to specific places on cue, creating choreography in groups).

**Role of the Teacher:** Observing technique, adjusting workload, ensuring safety.

**Role of the Students:** Physical and mental effort, collaboration, creativity.

## Part 2: Key Principles of the Imopeksis Methodology

### 2.1. Learning through Experience

Students learn through active participation, experimentation, and mutual interaction. The teacher does not impose ready solutions but creates conditions for independent discovery.

### 2.2. Role of the "Guardian"

Assigning students the role of "guardians" (leaders) promotes responsibility, collaboration, and mutual learning. Children often choose as "guardians" those who might not have had the chance to excel in a traditional model.

### 2.3. No Assessment and Comparison

Emphasis is placed on individual progress and self-improvement, rather than comparing oneself with others. Each student works at their own pace and within their capabilities.

### 2.4. Engaging the Brain

Exercises engage both brain hemispheres: the left (logic, sequences) and the right (imagination, creativity).

### 2.5. Concentration and Mindfulness

Exercises require students to focus their attention and be aware of their own bodies.

### 2.6. Adaptation and Flexibility

The teacher must be flexible and adapt exercises to the needs and capabilities of students.

### 2.7. Safety

Proper brain preparation (warm-up including lateralization and centering) minimizes the risk of injury and collisions.

## Summary

The presented lesson, based on the Imopeksis methodology, shows how lessons can be conducted in an engaging, effective, and safe manner. The key is to move away from the traditional teaching model, based on commands and assessment, towards creating conditions for independent learning, collaboration, and creativity. As a result, students not only develop their movement skills but also build confidence, learn concentration and cooperation, and above all, enjoy learning.`,
