  content: `# Introduction

This part of the training with Tomasz Wilczewski and Marta from Imopeksis continues the practical demonstration of the dance teaching methodology based on the concept of "quality of movement." The lesson progresses from individual exercises, through pair and group work, to creating simple choreographies, consistently emphasizing student-led learning, observation, and adaptation.

## Part 1: Repeating and Reinforcing the Quality of Movement

### 1.1. Station Work (with "Guardians")

The lesson begins with a review of the five basic "qualities of movement" at stations, led by students acting as "guardians":

- **Wave**: Smooth, undulating motion.
- **Swing**: Pendulum-like movement.
- **Shapes (Freezes)**: Maintaining static positions.
- **Shaking**: Body vibrations.
- **Pumping (Throws and Stops)**: Dynamic movements with pauses.

Students rotate between stations, with "guardians" providing guidance and ensuring correct exercise execution. The teacher observes and intervenes only when necessary, supporting the "guardians" and correcting any mistakes. The "guardians" are then rotated, giving other students the opportunity to take on the leadership role.

### 1.2. Modifications and Adaptations

During the station exercises, "guardians" and the teacher introduce modifications, such as:

- Focusing on a specific body part (e.g., "just the hand," "just the leg," "just the hips").
- Adding technical elements (e.g., "chin up").
- Changing movement dynamics (e.g., "move in this wave").
- Changing space (e.g., moving while performing the movement).

## Part 2: Transitioning to Complex Movement Forms

### 2.1. Movement Games

Students then move on to movement games integrating the learned qualities:

- **Responding to Signals**: One clap – "freezes" (Shapes), two claps – "waves" (Wave).
- **Tag with Movement Quality Elements**: A person tagged by the catcher performs a "wave" (Wave), and release occurs by mimicking this movement. Later, a "freeze with a leg" element is added.
- **Pair Work**: On a music cue, students pair up and perform any movements from the five learned qualities.
- **Work in Threes/Fours**: Each person in the group performs a different movement quality, requiring coordination and cooperation.

### 2.2. Adjusting Difficulty Levels

The teacher modifies the games, adjusting the difficulty level to the students' abilities, such as:

- Changing the tempo.
- Adding constraints (e.g., "only counts if the chin is up").
- Changing the rules (e.g., timing the hold of a position).

## Part 3: Utilising Space – "North, South, East, West"

### 3.1. Spatial Orientation

The concept of spatial orientation is introduced using compass directions:

- **North**: "Shaking" with just the legs.
- **South**: "Freezes" (Shapes) with added arm and leg movements.
- **East**: "Swing."
- **West**: (Students propose a movement quality).

Students run to the appropriate places on cue, performing their assigned movements.

### 3.2. Pair Collaboration

The exercise is modified for pair work, where students must jointly hold a "freeze" for a set time to earn a point.

## Part 4: Creating Choreography

### 4.1. Group Leadership

Students, divided into two teams, choose a leader who guides the group, combining the learned movement elements. The leaders are then changed.

### 4.2. Adding Conditions

Additional conditions are introduced, such as the whole team must perform a "freeze" for two seconds to earn a point.

### 4.3. Working on the Stomach

Exercises are modified to be performed while lying on the stomach.

### 4.4. Creating a Plan

Teams create their own short choreographic routines using the learned movement qualities.

### 4.5. Peer Teaching

Students from different teams teach each other their routines.

## Part 5: Summary and Homework

### 5.1. Reviewing Movement Qualities

Students recall the names and key elements of each "quality of movement."

### 5.2. Homework

Students are tasked with teaching someone (a parent, sibling, friend) one of the learned "qualities of movement" or the entire choreography.

## Summary

The lesson conducted by Tomasz Wilczewski and Marta demonstrates the practical application of the Imopeksis methodology in dance teaching. Through a gradual progression from simple exercises to more complex movement forms, engaging students in leadership roles, play, and creativity, the lesson creates conditions for effective learning, confidence building, and fostering positive group relationships. It is crucial to adapt exercises to students' abilities, observe and continuously adapt, and avoid traditional grading in favor of self-improvement and mutual support.`,
