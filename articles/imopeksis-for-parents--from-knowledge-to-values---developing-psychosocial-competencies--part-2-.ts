  content: `# Introduction

Continuing the Imopeksis training for parents, Tomasz Wilczewski delves deeper into the topic of psychosocial competences, embedding them in a hierarchical model of development: from knowledge, through skills and competences, to values, and then culture and transcendence. He focuses on practical guidance on how to support a child in natural development, avoiding the pitfalls of traditional upbringing and education.

## Part 1: Hierarchy of Competence Development – Reminder and Deepening

### 1.1. Four Pillars

- **Knowledge**: Basic information acquired from aware adults.
- **Skill**: The ability to practically apply knowledge and learn from mistakes.
- **Competence**: A lasting habit, agency in action, the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new situations.
- **Value**: A deep conviction in the rightness of a given competence, a level of selflessness.

### 1.2. Higher Levels

- **Individual Culture**: A person becomes a role model.
- **Team Culture**: A group of people guided by shared values.
- **Social Culture**: The influence of individuals and groups on society.
- **Transcendence**: The level of spiritual connection.

## Part 2: Key Social Competences (5-9 years) – Continuation

### 2.1. Cognitive Curiosity

- A child's natural curiosity is the driving force of their development.
- Adults should support this curiosity, not suppress it.
- The period of 10-12 years is a time of heightened curiosity ("fleeting enthusiasm").

### 2.2. Responsibility

- "Responsibility" – stepping back and allowing the child to make decisions and face consequences independently.
- Decision, risk, responsibility – three inseparable elements.
- Avoid giving advice and doing things for the child.
- Support, not replacement – discreetly supporting the child.

### 2.3. Moderation

- Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has.
- Research indicates a link with happiness.
- Avoiding consumerism.

### 2.4. Gratitude

- A key social competence.
- Children are naturally grateful.

### 2.5. Communication

- Four types of communication.
- The most important is intrapersonal.

### 2.6. Teamwork

- Develops gradually.

### 2.7. Generosity

- Emerges from the need of the heart.

### 2.8. Friendship

- Consists of empathy, tolerance, respect.

### 2.9. Love

- The highest level.

### 2.10. Sensitive Periods

- Wilczewski reminds about sensitive periods.

## Part 3: Practical Guidance for Parents and Teachers – Continuation

### 3.1. Avoiding "Words of Violence"

- Avoid words expressing command, compulsion, criticism, judgement, or comparison.

### 3.2. "Thinking in Situations"

- Analyse situations from the perspective of: situation, group, child.

### 3.3. Quiet Communication

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and with respect.

### 3.4. Giving Space

- A child needs space for independent thinking, action, and making mistakes.

### 3.5. Supporting, not Replacing

- Adults should support the child but not do things for them.

### 3.6. Recognising the Child's Reasons

- A child has their own reasons, which should be acknowledged and respected.

### 3.7. Reflection

- Reflection is key to the learning process.

### 3.8. Self-Realisation

## Part 4: Examples and Practical Application

### 4.1. Example from Basketball

Wilczewski provides an example from basketball, illustrating how to develop social competences (e.g., responsibility, cooperation, communication) through appropriate training methods and communication with players.

### 4.2. Example from Daily Life

He talks about a situation where a parent replaces the child in reflecting on hunger, hindering the development of independence.

### 4.3. The Importance of Gratitude

An example with birthdays.

### 4.4. Competition

Wilczewski discusses the negative effects of focusing on results in sports competition and proposes an alternative approach, centred on individual development and cooperation.

### 4.5. Teamwork

Wilczewski provides examples.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in upbringing and education. By understanding the child's psychology, needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools for creating an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, developing passions, and adapting communication and work methods to the individual characteristics of each child.`,
