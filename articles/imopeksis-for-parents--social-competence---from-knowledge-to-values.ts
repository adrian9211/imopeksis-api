  content: `# Introduction

In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski focuses on the development of social competencies in children and adolescents. He presents a hierarchical model that progresses from knowledge and skills, through competencies and values, to culture (individual, team, and social) and transcendence. He emphasizes the significance of the ages 5-9 as a critical period for shaping these competencies.

## Part 1: Hierarchy of Social Competency Development

### 1.1. Knowledge

- The foundation is knowledge, imparted to the child by conscious adults.
- It is important that this knowledge is conveyed in a way that encourages independent thinking.

### 1.2. Skill

- The child must have the opportunity to practically apply knowledge, make mistakes, and learn from them.

### 1.3. Competency

- Through repetition and refinement, the child develops competencies – lasting habits and agency in action.
- Competency is the ability to apply knowledge in new situations.

### 1.4. Value

- Value is a deep belief in the rightness of a given competency, a level of selflessness where action stems from an internal need.

### 1.5. Higher Levels

- **Individual Culture**: A person becomes a role model.
- **Team Culture**: A group of people guided by common values.
- **Social Culture**: The influence of individuals and groups on society.
- **Transcendence**: A level of spiritual connection, dedication to a higher purpose.

## Part 2: Key Social Competencies (Ages 5-9) – Detailed Discussion

### 2.1. Cognitive Curiosity

- A child's natural curiosity is the driving force of their development.
- Adults should support this curiosity rather than suppress it.
- Movement is the primary tool for a child to explore the world.
- Ages 10-12 are a time of heightened curiosity ("short-lived enthusiasm").
- Research shows a decline in creativity with age due to adult pressure and the education system.

### 2.2. Responsibility

- "Responsibility" – stepping back and allowing the child to make decisions and face consequences independently.
- Decision, risk, responsibility – three inseparable elements.
- Avoid advising and doing things for the child.
- Support rather than replace – discreetly supporting the child.

### 2.3. Moderation

- Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has.
- Research indicates a link between moderation and happiness.
- External pressure (societal expectations) and internal pressure (perfectionism) can lead to frustration.

### 2.4. Gratitude

- A key social competency.
- Children are naturally grateful, but adults often suppress this trait.

### 2.5. Empathy and Emotional Intelligence

- Children have a natural capacity for empathy.

### 2.6. Self-improvement

- Children have a natural drive for self-improvement and learning.

### 2.7. Defence of Autonomy

- Children have a strong need to defend their autonomy.

### 2.8. Sensitive Periods

- Desire for self-improvement.
- Strong sense of values.
- Period of negative behaviours.
- Searching for enemies.
- Asocial attitude.

- Honesty, straightforwardness.
- Short-lived enthusiasm.

## Part 3: Practical Tips for Parents

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.

### 3.4. Giving Space

- The child needs space for independent thinking, acting, and making mistakes.

### 3.5. Supporting, Not Replacing

- Adults should support the child but not do things for them.

### 3.6. Acknowledging the Child's Reasons

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, conducted by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in upbringing and education. By understanding the psychology of the child, their needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, developing passions, and adapting communication and working methods to the individual characteristics of each child. Parents play a crucial role in this process by supporting the child, but not doing things for them, giving them space for independent thinking and action, and teaching them gratitude, responsibility, and respect for themselves and others.`,
