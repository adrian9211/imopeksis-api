In this section of the Imopeksis training, Tomasz Wilczewski continues to discuss social competencies, focusing on a hierarchical model of development that progresses from knowledge to values, and then to higher levels of culture and transcendence. He emphasizes the importance of the 5-9 year age period as a critical time for shaping these competencies and presents specific examples of how to support a child in this process.

## Part 1: Hierarchy of Social Competence Development – Review and Deepening

### 1.1. Four Pillars

- **Knowledge**: Basic information that a child acquires from conscious adults.
- **Skill**: The ability to apply knowledge practically, learning from mistakes.
- **Competence**: A lasting habit, agency in action, the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new situations.
- **Value**: A deep belief in the rightness of a given competence, a level of selflessness.

### 1.2. Higher Levels

- **Individual Culture**: The person becomes a role model.
- **Team Culture**: A group of people guided by common values.
- **Social Culture**: The influence of the individual and group on society.
- **Transcendence**: The level of spiritual connection, dedication to a higher purpose.

## Part 2: Detailed Discussion of Social Competencies (5-9 years)

### 2.1. Cognitive Curiosity

- A child's natural curiosity is the driving force of their development.
- Adults should support this curiosity, not suppress it.
- Movement is a primary tool for a child to explore the world.
- The age of 10-12 years is a time of heightened curiosity ("flash in the pan").

### 2.2. Responsibility

- "Answer-ability" – to step back and allow the child to make their own decisions and face the consequences.
- Decision, risk, responsibility – three inseparable elements.
- Avoid advising and doing things for the child.
- Support, not substitution – discreetly supporting the child.

### 2.3. Moderation

- Moderation is the ability to enjoy what one has.
- Research indicates a link between moderation and happiness.
- External and internal pressures can lead to frustration.

### 2.4. Gratitude

- A key social competence.
- Children are naturally grateful, but adults often suppress this trait.

### 2.5. Communication

Four types:

- Intrapersonal
- Interpersonal
- Indirect
- Mediated

### 2.6. Teamwork

- It is a remedy for negative behaviours.
- Age diversity is important.
- It has its stages: from "I for others" through small and large groups to a team.

### 2.7. Generosity

- Generosity is more than just giving gifts.
- It comes from a need of the heart.

### 2.8. Friendship

- Consists of empathy, tolerance, respect, and selfless help.

### 2.9. Love

- The highest level.

## Part 3: Practical Tips for Parents and Teachers

### 3.1. Avoiding "Words of Violence"

- Avoid words that express command, coercion, criticism, judgment, or comparison.

### 3.2. "Situation Thinking"

- Analyse situations from the perspective of: the situation, the group, the child.

### 3.3. Quiet Communication

- Speak to the child quietly, calmly, and respectfully.

### 3.4. Giving Space

- A child needs space to think, act, and make mistakes independently.

### 3.5. Supporting, Not Substituting

- Adults should support the child but not do things for them.

### 3.6. Acknowledging the Child's Reasons

- A child has their own reasons, which should be acknowledged and respected.

### 3.7. Reflection

- Reflection is key to the learning process.

### 3.8. Sensitive Periods

- Wilczewski reminds us of sensitive periods.

## Summary

The Imopeksis training, led by Tomasz Wilczewski, is a call to change the paradigm in upbringing and education. By understanding a child’s psychology, needs, and natural predispositions, Imopeksis offers tools to create an environment where children can develop their full potential. The key is independence, reflection, cooperation, moderation, developing passion, and tailoring communication and work methods to the individual characteristics of each child. Parents and teachers play a crucial role in this process, supporting the child without substituting their actions, giving them space for independent thinking and acting, and teaching them gratitude, responsibility, and respect for themselves and others.`,
